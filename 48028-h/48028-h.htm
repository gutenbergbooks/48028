<h2><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION">INTRODUCTION.</a></h2>

<blockquote>

<p>"Si notre foi diffère quant à la forme et aux dogmes, nos âmes restent
toujours d'accord sur un principe éternel et divin."&mdash;<span class="smcap">George Sands.</span></p></blockquote>

<hr class="small" />
<p>An immense difficulty has to be encountered by those who
have been deeply impressed by the value and beauty of
Christianity when they are called upon to consider the
claims of other faiths. Anyone who has had within his
experience and under his observation such an exceptional
case as that of a sincere Christian who, from childhood to
old age, has set before him the ideal Christ and the Christian
conception of an all-compassionate Father&mdash;a Christian
whose inner light has been so pure that no darkness of
doubt has ever dimmed it, and no doctrinal warfare has ever
stained its radiance&mdash;he, I contend, has an almost insuperable
obstacle to overcome when he attempts to associate
holiness and purity, of the same supreme order, with the
followers of other religious systems which have been formulated
for the comfort and salvation of humanity.</p>

<p>It is doubtful if any ordinary adherent of the Christian
faith, however extensive his sympathies towards persons
outside his own flock, has ever been able to pass this barrier,
which always seems to interpose itself when search is made
for a common bond of union with an alien belief.</p>

<p>A man may have lived many a year in the East, and witnessed
there, with deep appreciation, the purity, the endurance,
the touching self-denial of the devout peasantry,
and the beautiful charity of the poor towards the poor; or
he may have associated with saintly ascetics in India, and
with the yellow-robed and gentle <i lang="fr">religieux</i> of Ceylon; he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span>
may have surveyed the famous temple of that fair island, in
the intense stillness of a tropical night, till all identity of self
seemed to vanish in the solemnity of the surroundings, and
the only sound was that of a monk's intoning voice heard
from within the dungeon-like apertures of the building, and
the only light that of the fitful fireflies amid the lofty and
drooping foliage;&mdash;yet, in each and all of these experiences,
that aroma of holiness, so perceptible at times in our own
religious atmosphere, would somehow seem strangely absent
to the unacclimatized senses, and no halo would be distinguishable
by a vision which had been restricted by prejudice.</p>

<p>Still more difficult is it to rise to the same height of
reverence for a saintly and surpassing personality if it is
presented in sacred records other than those to which one
has owned a prior allegiance. Nevertheless, the discovery
in other religious systems of a correspondence with one's
own particular persuasion must assuredly tend towards the
attainment of that attitude of mind commended by St. Paul
of "being all things to all men." To pave the way towards
the acquisition of this mental posture in relation to religious
concepts is the main object I have had in view in
composing this small book.</p>

<p>It has been said that no age has more needed a departure
in this direction than our own. "On the one hand,
sectarian hatred and dogmatism almost obscure the great
truths <em>common</em> to all mankind; on the other, merciless and
destructive criticism, in undermining much that used to be
generally accepted, seems at times to threaten even the
foundations of truth."</p>

<p>Some people, however, maintain that there is an appreciable
value to be attached to all dogmatic declarations, and
that those who are working in strictly-confined theological
grooves are contributing, as specialists, to a knowledge of
the whole. Even if these workers are possessed of all the
uncharitable qualities sometimes attributed to the narrow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[Pg ix]</a></span>-minded,
yet they may be held deserving of encouragement
in view of the probability that the more their limited ideas
become exposed to the light by their enthusiastic endeavours
to assert them as final truth, the sooner will their imperfections
be obliterated. The fragmentary opinions they cling
to will then be discovered to possess no value except as constituent
elements of the whole.</p>

<p>Others go the length of advocating that the flames of
bigotry should be fanned to furnace-heat in order that the
feeding fuel may be the more rapidly consumed.</p>

<p>In any case, the more apparent it becomes that every
religion worthy of the name springs from a root common to
all, and is really, at bottom, the one true cosmic religion,
and that the variations are superficial and unimportant in
themselves, the greater will be the advantages accruing to
humanity in the political, social, and moral spheres. In
other words, the advantage to be derived from the study
of the obscure phases of religions lies in this&mdash;that, in so
doing, our minds are better able to grasp the solidarity of
religious thought and aspirations throughout the world.
We are enabled to see more clearly that all religious forms,
and even formless philosophies, however crude and idolatrous
the former may appear to people of wide culture, and
however mystical and evasive the latter may be regarded
by those of narrow vision, are but the effects of one cause
common to all.</p>

<p>When we have got rid, Buddhistically, of the idea of
separateness, or, in a Christian sense, have exercised self-suppression,
we can then proceed to eliminate the notion of
separateness in religions and philosophies. Thus, whether
we are Determinists or Indeterminists, we shall experience
the sensation that, according to the law of development,
it is in the scheme of things for us to struggle forward on
our several paths, not in antipathy to, but hand in hand
with, those who make use of different modes of progression
towards one identical goal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</a></span></p>

<p>Missionary propagandism, under these conditions, will
have the same <i lang="fr">raison d'être</i>, and our cherished symbolisms
will in no wise suffer. Holding this view, I have felt no
misgivings as to the propriety of placing side by side, as it
were, the historical and radiant figures of Jesus the Christ
and Gotama the Buddha, and of indicating an analogy
between the essential features of the two systems of religion
which these great deliverers of a world on earth have
fashioned and commended for the acceptance of their
fellow creatures.</p>

<p>Indeed, Buddhism should occupy a very large place in the
affections and admiration of all true Christians on account of
the many points of resemblance discernible in the characters
and gospels of Gotama and Jesus.</p>

<p>St. Augustine, the great vindicator of Christianity, clears
the ground for an assimilation of the two systems.
He writes: "For the thing in itself which is now
called the Christian religion really was known to the
ancients, nor was wanting at any time, from the beginning
of the human race until the time that Christ came
into the flesh, from which the true religion which had
previously existed began to be called Christian; and this in
our day is the Christian religion&mdash;not as having been
wanting in former times, but as having in later times
received this name."</p>

<p>Köppen says: "As, from the standpoint of Buddhism,
all men&mdash;nay, all beings&mdash;are brothers, children of one sin,
sons of the same nonentity, thus all religions of the globe
appear to it as related, as sprung from one source; all
pursuing the same end, and arriving at the same goal.
The religious views, creeds, etc., etc. ... of all nations,
Churches, schools, sects, and parties, however diverse they
may seem, are hence, according to the conception of the
believing Buddhist, not alien, but inwardly akin. They
are merely peculiar forms, modifications, obscurations,
degenerations of the same truth&mdash;of one law, one faith, one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[Pg xi]</a></span>
redemption. For him there is only one doctrine and one
Way; and all religions belong, in one way or another, to
this doctrine, and are all on that Way."</p>

<p>Among the things that can never be shaken are the
foundations of Christianity, Islam and Buddhism, and
other cognate religious systems. Here and there, perchance,
a steeple may come down with a crash, a minaret
may fall, a pagoda crumble into dust; but the foundation-stones,
laid beneath the surface, buried in mystery, and
encompassed by darkness, remain irremoveable, changeless,
and eternal.</p>

<p>It is, then, in this brooding darkness which envelopes
their occult sources that we must take our stand; and
not until we have grown into and become one with the
encircling gloom, and been subjectively steeped in it,
can we hope to understand or pronounce a fair judgment
upon what is the less obscure and objective.</p>

<p>The comparative study of religions requires approach
with an open and receptive mind, and a large amount of
intuitive sympathy with all. It cannot be fairly undertaken
if the initial object of investigation is to mould the one or
the other to the shape of personal fancy.</p>

<p>Mr. Arthur Lillie, a most interesting exponent of
Buddhism in relation to Christianity, says that the study
of an ancient religion is not philosophy, but pure history.
This may be true, in a sense; but, at the same time, it is
necessary that the records of the past should be studied in
a philosophical and synthetic spirit, with an Impressionist
rather than a pre-Raphaelite tendency. Mr. Lillie hardly
makes due allowance for the measure of failure which must
accompany all human efforts to do justice to a great idea,
and perhaps overstrains the theory that literary and philological
analysis have had their day, and that archæology and
history should now reign supreme.</p>

<p>In connection with the placing of too great a reliance
upon the "letter" of venerated records, a warning&mdash;serious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[Pg xii]</a></span>
enough if we appropriate it to ourselves&mdash;has issued from
the pen of the Rev. Spence Hardy, who, in a passage of
his book, entitled <em>Eastern Monachism</em> (p. 166), emphasizes
with tremendous force the precarious position of those who
take their stand solely upon sacred books. "The priests
of India," he writes, "are encompassed by weapons that
may be wrested from their hands and used to their own
destruction. When it is clearly proved to them that their
venerated records contain absurdities and contradictions,
they must of necessity conclude that their origin cannot
have been divine; and, the foundations of the system being
thus shaken, the whole mass must speedily fall, leaving only
the unsightly ruin as a monument of man's folly, when he
endeavours to form a religion from the feculence of his own
corrupt heart or the fancies of his own perverted imagination."</p>

<p>It may be apposite here to demonstrate how far short of
the Pauline standard the cultivated European critic falls, by
referring to some remarks of the Rev. Prof. Bruce in one of his
Gifford Lectures<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> of last year, in which he treats of Gotama's
views concerning the moral order of the universe. Of the
two leading doctrines of Buddhism, Karma is called by
him "fantastic" and Nirvana "morbid"; and, not content
with such a contemptuous dismissal of these remarkable conceptions,
he proceeds to say: "The well-being of the race
demanded warriors, brave in the field of battle against evil,
not monks, immured in cloisters and passing their lives in
poverty, wearing the yellow robe of a mendicant order."</p>

<p>This rhetorical flourish may have sounded very effective
and convincing as a peroration, and have produced
the desired result of clearing the lecturer from any
possible imputation of sympathy with Buddhism, except
as an ethical system of considerable excellence; but such a
summing-up of Buddhism is neither more nor less than a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[Pg xiii]</a></span>
throwing of dust in the eyes of beholders, and is, in my
opinion, very far removed from the dispassionate survey
one would expect from a Gifford Lecturer. Alighting
on such a misrepresentation of his religious system, a
Buddhist would naturally feel aggrieved, and his belief in
our self-adopted reputation for fair-play all round might be
rudely shaken.</p>

<p>"Karma" is undoubtedly one of the so-called mysteries
of Buddhism; but is it in any sense more fantastic than
any other religious mystery? Is this theory of the transmigration
of character (as it has been somewhat loosely
described) more fanciful in its conception than that of the
transmigration of the soul, a "vaguely-apprehended, feebly-postulated
ego," to a dim locality such as heaven? Then,
again, it may be asked, what is there so objectionable in
a quiet, unobtrusive resistance to evil, that it should
prompt the lecturer to magnify the importance of a crude
aggressiveness?</p>

<p>It is by no means true that Buddhist monks are usually
immured in cloisters; they, in fact, move about freely as
examples, within human limits, of the highest morality, and
they chiefly occupy themselves (as in Burma) with the
education of children.<a name="FNanchor_B_2" id="FNanchor_B_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a> General Forlong, in his <cite>Short
Studies in the Science of Comparative Religions</cite>, says:
"Gotama's religion widened from Jaino-Buddhism into one
of work and duty towards his fellows; his instructions to
the order of monks were to the following effect: that
they were not to <em>beg</em> from door to door, but only to accept
gifts in return for services performed; and this was their
service&mdash;to be an example to all men."</p>

<p>Condemnation of these monks for passing their lives in
poverty sounds strangely inappropriate coming from the lips<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[Pg xiv]</a></span>
of a Christian professor; and, as to the well-being of the
race not demanding the wearing of yellow garments, one
might reasonably ask if it demanded the wearing of a black
gown. We must, in all fairness, I think, credit Gotama with
possessing a large measure of that "Light which lighteth
<em>every man</em> that cometh into the world."</p>

<p>Sir Edwin Arnold, I believe, refers to the mysteries of
Buddhism as "blank abstractions," but I do not suppose
he regards them as more "blank" than the mysteries of
other religions. All mysteries are, in a sense, blank
abstractions, and the blanker they are the nearer the
truth; and what religion is without them? It may be conceded,
however, that such a conception as "Ultimate
Reality" upon which to fall back in time of need might prove
to some minds a more comfortless one than that presented
by the "Compassionate Father" of the Christian God-idea.
But even this Christian symbolism has an element of
mystery in it.</p>

<p>Then there is the poetic phase of anthropomorphism,
which is not altogether to be despised from an æsthetic
point of view. Such as the Mohammedan Allah, who is
described with exquisite imagery in the Bost&#257;n of Sâdi as
a beautiful cup-bearer at Sufistic banquets,</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse"><span class="i20">"So fair,<br /></span></div>
<div class="verse"><span class="i0">They spill the wine and stare,"<a name="FNanchor_C_3" id="FNanchor_C_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_3" class="fnanchor">[C]</a><br /></span></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>which recalls the anthropomorphic Deity of the Psalms:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse"><span class="i0">"In His hand is a cup, and the wine is red."<br /></span></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Another picture of great poetical merit is that of the
Incarnate Saviour of the Mexicans, who does not ascend
to heaven on his departure from the earth, but sets forth
upon the wide ocean in a wizard bark of serpent skins for
the fabled shores of the kingdom of his Father.</p>

<p>Dr. Paul Carus, in his preface to <cite>The Gospel of Buddha</cite>,
says: "A comparison of the many striking agreements
between Christianity and Buddhism may prove fatal to a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[Pg xv]</a></span>
sectarian conception of Christianity, but will in the end
only help to mature our insight into the essential nature of
Christianity, and so elevate our religious convictions. It
will bring out that nobler Christianity which aspires to be
the cosmic religion of universal truth.... It will serve both
Christians and Buddhists as a help to penetrate further
into the spirit of their faith, so as to see its full width,
breadth, and depth."</p>

<p>The theological formation which has gradually developed
into what may be called the crust of creeds, and which has
probably now reached its limits of hardening, is seen, from
day to day, under varying influences, to be cracking into
wider and deeper fissures. The curious inquirer now
possesses ample opportunities of looking below the surface
and observing some of the conditions that have, in the
course of ages, given rise to the accretions.</p>

<p>The deeper we look, or the further our horizon recedes,
the greater perhaps is the sense of bewilderment and isolation;
yet so to wander is, at any rate, to be free; and we
need not just at present fear that ultimate knowledge is
nescience, when our vision will no longer be bounded by
any horizon, and when even vision itself will at last disappear.</p>

<p>As it has been stated of science, so it may be affirmed of
all inquiry, "that at a certain stage of its development a
degree of vagueness best consists with fertility."</p>

<p>Christianity and Buddhism possess three prominent
features&mdash;"the metaphysical," "the ethical," and "the
biographical." As the two latter have been so exhaustively
contrasted in connection with these systems, I have confined
myself in the following pages chiefly to a consideration of
their mystical relationship.</p>

<hr class="small" />

<p>In any attempt to appreciate the relationship of Christianity
to Buddhism it is important to bear in mind, not only the
differences which have characterized the process of their
evolution, but also to recognize that the two religions are,
in their origin, distinct as to time and <i lang="fr">locale</i>; that they
developed on different soils, and have borne fruit of very
different kinds; and that the races which subsequently
appropriated them as religious systems were in many
respects dissimilar, and lived under widely divergent conditions.
Only by regarding these religions as growing apart,
and in no manner connected in this sense, can we ultimately
arrive at a just and logical estimate of the character of the
founders.</p>

<p>It is not by confounding their sources at the start, or by
attempting to prove that the one system is a product of the
other, that we can in the end draw closer the bonds which
seem to unite them. A consideration of almost equal weight
is that of the dual nature of the great personalities of Jesus
and Gotama. We must not confuse the significance of the
term "God" with the man Jesus, nor the mystical principle
embodied in the title "Buddha" with the personal and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
human Gotama. Both Jesus as God and Gotama as
Buddha are dual personalities, and combine in themselves
tangible and intangible realities. The former is to be
regarded as man and God, the latter as Gotama and
Buddha.</p>

<p>But, while wishing to emphasize the fact of the independent
origin of Christianity and Buddhism, I have no
intention of combating the fact that a spurious Buddhism
had, in the garb of Essenism, established a footing
in Palestine at a date anterior to the Christian era, and that,
under the influence of St. John the Baptist, the recognized
leader of the Essenes, a way was prepared and made ready
for the great light which was to shine forth afresh in the
majestic humanity of Jesus. The presence of Essene
Buddhists in Palestine at that date is a matter of history, and
has been clearly established by prominent Oriental scholars.
Moreover, the Church of England itself has, through the
medium of some of its most reliable authorities, openly
acquiesced in the fact.</p>

<p>The Essenes, who were, from the second century before
Christ onwards, domiciled in the Holy Land, although
virtually Buddhists, do not seem to have preserved intact
the tenets of Gotama, though the ethics remained unadulterated.
They retained many of the qualities of the
monastic Buddhists, such as asceticism, brotherly love, a
rare benevolence towards mankind in general, and the still
rarer consideration for animal life. Nor was any departure
made from the vows of chastity, the belief in the transitory
nature of things, and in their attitude of non-resistance to
evil. It was rather with regard to metaphysical obscurities
that they wandered from the strict teaching of Gotama; and
we cannot wonder that such was the case when we remember
the doubts, difficulties, and uncertainties that must have
beset the paths of these followers of Gotama when they had
no longer the Enlightened One to point to them the way of
truth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span></p>

<p>Especially do they seem to have gone astray in the matter
of the doctrine of the soul. This they described "as coming
from the subtlest ether, and as lured by the sorcery of
nature into the prison-house of the body." The Essenes
derived their Buddhistic tenets and practices directly from
Gnosticism, which is said to have prevailed in Alexandria
two centuries before the birth of Christ, and its existence
in that city owed its origin to the importation of Buddhism
from India, constant communication having been established
in those days between Egypt and the West Coast of India
as far north as the mouths of the Indus.</p>

<p>Further, the edicts of King Asoka go to prove that at
about this time he was on intimate terms and in frequent
correspondence with the Greeks; also, that during his reign
and under his royal patronage Buddhist missionaries found
their way to Egypt, and there scattered the seed from which
arose the Gnostics, or Therapeuts, and the kindred sect of
the Essenes.</p>

<p>Mr. Arthur Lillie, in his <cite>Buddhism in Christendom</cite>, p. 75,
writes: "The most subtle thinker of the modern English
Church, the late Dean Mansel, boldly maintained that the
philosophy and rites of the Therapeuts of Alexandria were
due to Buddhist missionaries who visited Egypt within two
centuries of the time of Alexander the Great. In this he
has been supported by philosophers of the calibre of
Schelling and Schopenhauer and the great Sanscrit authority
Lassen. Renan, in his work <cite>Les Langues Sémétiques</cite>, also
sees traces of this Buddhist propagandism in Palestine
before the Christian era. Hilgenfeld, Mutter, Bohlen,
King, all admit the Buddhist influence. Colebrooke saw
a striking similarity between the Buddhist philosophy and
that of the Pythagoreans. Dean Milman was convinced
that the Therapeuts sprung from the 'contemplative and
indolent fraternities' of India."</p>

<p>When we travel back from Essenism to Gnosticism we
approach nearer geographically and conceptionally to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
source from which they both originated. Gnosticism, however,
presumes to tell us more than Gotama chose to reveal
as to the beginnings of things, and enters into details about
various spiritual emanations which are at variance with any
inferences that can be legitimately drawn from early
Buddhism.</p>

<p>In the <cite>Encyclopædia Britannica</cite>, under "Gnosticism," we
read: "The Supreme Being, according to Gnosticism, was
regarded as wholly inconceivable and indescribable; as the
Unfathomable Abyss; the Unnameable. From this transcendant
source existence sprang by emanation in a series
of spiritual powers. It was only through these several
powers that the Infinite passed into life and activity, and
became capable of representation. To this higher world
was given the name of Pleroma, and the divine powers composing
it in their ever-expanding procession from the Highest
were called Æons."</p>

<p>Jesus, according to the Gnostic conception, was one of
these higher Æons or Buddhas "proceeding from the
Kingdom of Light for the redemption of this lower Kingdom
of Darkness."</p>

<p>If the above was whittled down to the bare statement
that the Boundless, to be made perceptible, had to become
active and creative, and that thus it happened that the Boundless
was manifested by and in the universe, Gnosticism, on this
point, would not greatly differ from what was probably in
the mind of Gotama when he pointed out that the Uncreated
or Unproduced must have existence, otherwise the created,
the produced, could not be.</p>

<p>In face of the historically-established fact that Buddhism
had reached Palestine before the Christian era had commenced,
and that Buddhistic influences were widely disseminated
throughout the Holy Land when Jesus arose
upon the scene, I wish to maintain that Jesus, although
nurtured in the mixed society of ceremonial and Essenic
Jews, cannot be claimed as belonging to the Essenes or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
any other sect <em>after</em> he emerged from his long retirement
and commenced his ministry. During the time of his withdrawal
from publicity it must be assumed that he was growing
in wisdom, and continued to do so until the perfect enlightenment
came to him, when the Holy Ghost descended upon
him, and he knew himself to be the Son and symbol of
God, and, as such, capable of revealing the mysteries of
the kingdom of heaven to those who had ears to hear and
eyes to see. This view, or reading, of the Scriptures was
the cardinal tenet of the adoptionist Christology of the
Paulician school in Armenia.</p>

<p>Jesus, as human, was undoubtedly begotten, not made,
and died. Jesus, as divine, became so, not by the conversion
of the Godhead into flesh, but by taking of the <em>manhood</em>
into God&mdash;first the natural, after that the spiritual, as
St. Paul says. Jesus, as God, was immortal.</p>

<p>Jesus, as a perfected soul on earth, was a presentation
of the Logos, in the sense given to this term by Dr. Paul
Carus, "as forms of speech," which, containing in words
eternal truth, is the most important part of the human soul,
when soul is regarded as the formative factors of the various
forms and their relations that have been evolving, and are
constantly evolving and re-evolving. Jesus was, in this
respect, altogether independent of his <em>entourage</em>, although a
part of it in all other relations. He utilized what was good
and answered his purpose in the tenets of the several
sections of the society in which he moved. He was an
eclectic, and stood midway between mystical and anti-mystical
Israel.</p>

<p>The Essenes, as already stated, derived their doctrines
and customs chiefly from the Gnostics of Egypt, and the
origin of the latter has been traced to the propagation of
Buddhism by Indian missionaries sent to Egypt in the time
of King Asoka.</p>

<p>Now, Gotama Buddha was, in point of time, an earlier
presentation of Logos; and, as Gotama's influences were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
at work in Palestine when Jesus appeared, it follows in the
natural course of things that Jesus, as a presentation of this
same Logos, or Bodhi, would have shown a stronger leaning
towards the tenets and practices of the Essenes than towards
those of the ceremonial Jews.</p>

<p>The position of Jesus in Palestine closely corresponded
with that of Gotama in Hindustan. Gotama was isolated
between the ceremonial Brahmin class and the extreme
mystical party. He also assimilated, as Jesus did, in
furtherance of his mission, some of the tenets of each party,
with certain modifications. He shocked the ceremonialists
by showing disdain for rites as rites, and estranged himself
from the extreme mystical party by refusing to give his
imprimatur to factitious asceticism. In the same manner
Jesus ignored some of the Essenic restrictions by partaking
of wine and animal food.</p>

<p>Brahmanism suffered corruption through the acquisition
by the priests of wealth and power. To the endowment of
the Christian Church, and the elevation of its priests to
temporal sway by the Emperor Constantine, has been attributed
the beginning of the decadence of the Christian ideal.
The decline of true Buddhism in India was due in a great
measure to the munificence of King Asoka, who erected
and enriched monasteries and other religious institutions.
This led ultimately to many serious abuses, as well as to
deviations from the precepts which Gotama had endeavoured
to inculcate.</p>

<p>In Palestine, at the commencement of the Christian era,
the ceremonial Jews or Pharisees,<a name="FNanchor_D_4" id="FNanchor_D_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_D_4" class="fnanchor">[D]</a> though a numerically
small section, were the dominant party of Judaism, and
were represented by dignitaries of an overbearingly proud<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
demeanour. Suppressed by them, the spirituality of the
Essene Buddhists was thrown into the shade, and, when the
voice crying in the wilderness was no longer to be heard
and the commanding personality of St. John the Essene
disappeared from the scene, Essenism as an organization
came to an end.</p>

<p>To contend with these ceremonialists of Palestine and
the corrupt Brahmanism of India, and to further the
success of their respective missions in the face of these
formidable forces, both Jesus in the one case and Gotama
in the other realized the expediency of initiating a mode of
proselytism which, by the humble bearing and unworldly
aspect of its agents, would differentiate it from the arrogant
and exclusive methods of the priestly classes. The missionaries
whom these new lights sent forth into the
world to propagate the doctrine of salvation received
explicit instructions not to provide themselves with gold or
silver, or change of raiment and shoes; in fact, they were
to pose as examples of that humility and forbearance which
was the keynote, in their ethical significance, of the two
systems as formulated for the redemption of humanity.
In both cases the spell of this evangelism was soon to be
lost in a resurgence of the very evils it was intended to
suppress&mdash;the pride of ecclesiasticism and the ascendancy
of ritual&mdash;under the widening shadows of which the underlying
truths of symbolism became obscured.</p>

<p>As told in the story of the Great Renunciation, Gotama
goes into retirement at an early age; Jesus also becomes a
recluse. It is probable that he spent the years elapsing
between his adolescence and the commencement of his
ministry among the Essenes, who dwelt in caves in the
vicinity of the Dead Sea, where he would have found ample
opportunity for meditation, as well as genial companionship
at hand, if desired.</p>

<p>Jesus and Gotama both issued from their retreats and
mystic communions, impregnated with a deep sympathy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
for a suffering world, for the weary and heavy laden. They
both accentuated with the same fervour of conviction the
futility of laying up treasure upon earth, and pointed to the
same mysterious heaven where true joy alone was to be
found. But none of the dicta of Gotama have approached,
either in a doctrinal sense or in uncompromising severity,
the declaration of the Prophet of Nazareth as to the absolute
necessity of renouncing the most sacred family ties before
acceptance could be possible as a true and faithful disciple:
"If any man come to me, and hate not his father, and
mother, and wife, and brethren, and sisters, yea, and his
own life too, he cannot be my disciple."</p>

<p>The use of vehement declamations of this nature was
probably forced upon the speaker by the condition of those
days, when it was more than ever necessary to draw a sharp
line and to emphasize the depth of the chasm that must
divide followers of the ideal from those in thrall to the
material. It has been remarked by Mr. Lillie that, if Jesus
had had to deal with people in a later or more advanced
state of civilization, other methods and other language would
in all probability have been used to suit the altered conditions.</p>

<p>The attitude towards relations which Jesus, in the above-quoted
passage, seems to have expected a disciple to
assume may receive some elucidation from a story told in
Visuddhi-Maga, which is headed by the translator, Mr.
H. C. Warren,<a name="FNanchor_E_5" id="FNanchor_E_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_E_5" class="fnanchor">[E]</a> "And Hate Not his Father and Mother."
The story, briefly related, is to this effect:&mdash;</p>

<p>A young man left his father's house, and, having joined
the Buddhist order of mendicants, was lost sight of by his
parents. The mother sorrowed for the long absence of her
son.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the young monk had been allotted a cell in a
certain monastery. But it so happened that this cell had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
been provided at the expense of his father, who was a devout
layman. When the father heard that the cell had been
occupied, he set forth to visit the occupant, and, as was
customary, to beg him to seek his alms at his house for a
space of three months. The young monk appeared at the
door of the cell, in his yellow robe and with shaven head,
and, unrecognized by his father, accepted the invitation to
receive alms at the house of the layman.</p>

<p>Day after day he attended at the threshold of his father's
house, and took food from the hands of his parents. Still
the mother continued to grieve for her long-absent son,
accounting him dead.</p>

<p>One day, as the monk was returning towards the
monastery, after parting on the road with his mother, the
latter's brother, an elder, overtook her. She fell at her
brother's feet, weeping and lamenting for her son.</p>

<p>"Then thought the elder: 'Surely this lad, through the
moderateness of his passions, must have gone away without
announcing himself.' And he comforted her, and told her
the whole story. The lay woman was pleased, and, lying
prostrate, with her face in the direction in which her son
had gone, she worshipped, saying: 'Methinks the Blessed
One must have had in mind a body of priests like my son
when he preached the course of conduct customary with
the great saints, showing how to take delight in the cultivation
of content.... This man ate for three months in the
house of the mother who bore him, and never said, 'I am
thy son, and thou art my mother.'... For such a one
<em>mother and father</em> are no hindrances, much less any other
lay devotees."</p>

<p>On one occasion, when I was privileged to attend an
ordination service at Kandy, I was much struck with an
incident which occurred at this time-old ceremony. At the
conclusion of the service, when the melodious intoning of
the celebrants had ceased to reverberate in the solemn ruins
of the dimly-lighted aisle, the young initiate was placed at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
the bottom of the row of monks, who were seated, cross-legged,
in the nave of the temple. During the service the
lay spectators had been railed off at the entrance, which
faced the shrine, beneath which the chief abbot presided.
But, when the newly-ordained monk had assumed a sitting
posture in the place assigned to him, the railing was
removed, and his female relations&mdash;perhaps his "beloved
one" among them&mdash;came forward and prostrated themselves
at his feet. The initiate sat with downcast eyes,
unmoved by the demonstration, recalling to mind one of
those statues of Buddha in which the countenance is represented
with that abstracted yet compassionate expression so
characteristic of the Perfect One. Then also was brought
to my recollection that saying of Jesus recorded in the
Gospel when he turned towards his mother and exclaimed:
"Woman, what have I to do with thee?"</p>

<p>It may, I think, be indisputably affirmed that the deep
insight of these great reformers into the problems of life, the
profound impression they made upon a vain world, their
sublimated ideas, their superhuman influences, their stainless
lives&mdash;that all these proclaim them to have been
veritable embodiments of the mystic Sophia and one with
God. Separated only by the time appointed for their
appearance in the world, they were both presentations of
the same Logos, called in Buddhistic terminology "Bodhi"
or Intelligence. Whether there was a difference between
the quality of presentation in the cases of Jesus and Gotama,
whether the one produced a more flamboyant light than the
other, and in what respects and how the media differed, are
questions that can only be answered by Christians and
Buddhists themselves, according to the light that is in them.</p>

<p>In the person of Jesus the human became divine. It
was not a case of the conversion of the godhead into the
flesh.</p>

<p>The whole of the so-called Athanasian Creed, read in the
light of positive psychology, appears to be a statement of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
many important truths, and, for all we know, it may be
literally true that, unless a man makes this creed his own
and acts up to it, he cannot be saved in the sense indicated.
The creed is applicable to the needs of the whole world,
and, therefore, is rightly called the Catholic faith. Unfortunately
its patristic terminology has led the unenlightened
to conclude that it is exclusive and sectarian; consequently,
many earnest Christians have evinced an inclination to reject
it, and efforts have been made to have it expunged from the
Liturgy of the Church of England.</p>

<p>Although it may be accepted as a true statement that the
typical Hindu mind, which ranges over such a vast area of
speculation, will never be induced by missionary zeal to
confine itself within the apparently limited formulæ of
Christian doctrine, it must not be overlooked that even the
symbolism of Christianity represents and covers a shoreless
ocean in which thought can disport itself without ever
coming into contact with the limitations of the concrete.
The Hindu mind binds itself, as it has been said of Art, to
no creeds, no articles of faith, no schemes of salvation, no
confessions. It cannot by its very nature. The unconditioned
is its country, its native land, its home.</p>

<p>Christ rose from the dead, as the purified soul of man
will at last be detached from the conditioned, though still
remaining a quality of the conditioned. The Christ
principle, the Comforter, or the Holy Ghost, does not, with
the ascension of Christ, leave us comfortless, but stays with
us to the end.</p>

<p>With regard to the posthumous appearance of Jesus and
all phenomena of a like nature, it is not easy to find room
in positive psychology for such a thing as a docetic body;
yet it would seem absolutely needful for the logical expansion
of such a science to include, as a speculative possibility,
the seeming existence of loose integrations of matter
with apparent form and outline, of vaporous counterparts of
animal organisms, of aspects of matter not familiar to mankind,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
having a place in the general scheme of the apparitional
world.<a name="FNanchor_F_6" id="FNanchor_F_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_F_6" class="fnanchor">[F]</a></p>

<p>Further, unless we doggedly refuse to rely on the published
experiences of eminent and trustworthy men, such as
Mr. Myers and his associates, the case of Mrs. Piper must
be taken <i lang="fr">au sérieux</i>. Those who accept an animistic
solution have undoubtedly cleared a fence, but there still
remains an obstacle before them in the shape of the definition
of "spirit."</p>

<p>In seeking for an interpretation that will harmonize with
the general tenor of Buddhistic philosophy and positive
psychology, it is incumbent that the irrefragable "Law of
Causation," <i lang="fr">à l'&#339;uvre</i> in the phenomenal world, should be
taken into account, and any attempted effort of explanation
of unfamiliar powers, such as those exhibited by mediums,
demands that a place should be found for them in the
mosaic of cause and effect. Mediumistic powers, it seems
to me, are merely an extension of the faculty of expression-reading.
Efferent nerves discharge impressions which can
be read. Everyone, more or less, can read the expressions
of a face, and learn thereby, to a limited and imperfect
extent, the thoughts of an individual. In the case of the
medium, the terminal organs of the afferent nerves being
hyper-sensitive, the medium is able to do more than read in
a general way the thought of a person by the impression
conveyed through the discharge of the efferent nerves of a
person. A medium, therefore, receives, in proportion to
the degree of hyper-sensitiveness possessed by the terminal
organs of the afferent nerves, the intimate knowledge harboured
in the brain-cells of another person, which is constantly
being discharged by the efferent nerves of that
person. These powers, which I relegate to the realm of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
causation, must not be confounded with "Bodhi," or
"Logos," which is not subject to any phenomenal law.</p>

<p>The founder of the Brahmo Somaj, Keshub Chunder
Sen, idealized Christ as a universal principle in these
striking sentences:&mdash;</p>

<p>"As the sleeping Logos did Christ live potentially in the
Father's bosom, long, long before he came into this world
of ours.... Wherever there is intelligence, in all stages
of life, where there is the least spark of instinct, there dwells
Christ, if Christ is the Logos. In this right and rational
view do not the Fathers all agree? Do they not speak of
an all-pervading Christ? Do not they bear unequivocal
testimony to Christ in Socrates? Even in barbarian philosophy
and in all Hellenic literature they saw and adored
their Logos, Christ.... I deny and repudiate the little
Christ of popular theology, and stand up for a greater Christ,
a fuller Christ, a more eternal Christ, a more universal
Christ.</p>

<p>"I plead for the eternal Logos of the Fathers, and I
challenge the world's assent.</p>

<p>"This is the Christ who was in Greece and Rome, in
Egypt and in India. In the bards and the poets of the
Rig-Veda was he. He dwelt in Confucius and in Sakya
Muni (Gotama Buddha). This is the true Christ, whom I
can see everywhere, in all lands and in all times, in Europe
and in Asia, in Africa, in America, in ancient and modern
times. He is not the monopoly of any nation or creed.
All literature, all science, all philosophy, every doctrine that
is true, every form of righteousness, every virtue that belongs
to the Son, is the true subjective Christ, whom all ages
glorify. He is pure intelligence (Bodhi), the word of God,
mighty Logos. Scattered in all schools of philosophy and
in all religious sects, scattered in all men and women of the
East and the West, are multitudinous Christ-principles and
fragments of Christ-life, one vast and identical Sonship
diversely manifested."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span></p>

<p>The writer of an article in a review<a name="FNanchor_G_7" id="FNanchor_G_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_G_7" class="fnanchor">[G]</a> says that the
expression, Logos, is introduced "with startling suddenness
by St. John in the exordium of his Gospel, and that there
is nothing in the Old Testament or in the Synoptic Gospels
to prepare the way for it, or to explain it." He inclines,
the writer says, to attribute the introduction of the idea by
St. John to the influence of Philo-Judæus, who elaborated
it from the account of the Creation given in Genesis, to
such an extent that he came to call the Logos, or intermediary
power, the Son of God. Philo, after profound
meditation, to quote his own words, "heard even a more
solemn voice from my soul, <em>accustomed often to be possessed
by God and to discourse of things which it knew not</em>, which,
if I can, I will recall." Philo, the writer says, must have
"observed that the Mosaic cosmogony leaves the <i lang="la">modus
operandi</i> of creation in obscurity. The account given
is '<em>God said</em>, Let there be light,' and so on. Thus
the spoken word of God is represented as the efficient
cause of creation. But to attribute speech to the Most
High was manifestly a concession to the frailty of the human
intellect."</p>

<p>Mr. W. E. Ball concedes that the Logos-idea was prevalent
in the East long before the time of the Evangelist, and
in this connection he refers to the Vedic vach or speech.
This notion also possibly emanated from a cosmogony
similar to that found in Genesis. He proceeds to say "that
the editors of the Septuagint deliberately set themselves to
soften down those passages in the earlier books of the Bible
which were conceived to be most open to the charge of
anthropomorphism. A single example will suffice. In
Exodus xxiv. 9-11 it is related that Moses and Aaron,
Nadab and Abihu, and seventy elders, ascended Mount
Sinai '<em>and saw the God of Israel</em>.' The Hebrew text is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
clear beyond dispute; but in the Septuagint the passage
reads, 'and saw the place where the God of Israel stood.'"
Then we are referred to the "one living and true God, who,
according to the Christian articles of faith, is without body,
parts, or passions." As, however, in the Christian Scriptures
it was recorded that he had been seen and conversed
with, it became necessary to assume an emanation or intermediary
power for this speaking and visible phase of God;
hence, first, the unpersonified Logos of Philo, and afterwards
the Logos made flesh in the person of Jesus according
to St. John. The writer thinks that, however much the
conception of Philo in the direction of a Logos as the
Son of God may be minimized in its importance (on
account of Philo's silence on the divine human as a Messiah)
with reference to its bearing upon the writings of St. John,
there is no doubt that Philo supplied "a theological
vocabulary for the expression of Johannine and Pauline
doctrine." "St. John grasped Philo's conception of the word
as not only the revelation of the <em>silent</em> God, but also as a
reflection of the invisible God." "Jesus never described
himself as the son of God." Such endeavours, however, as
the above to fix the genesis and growth of an idea from a
concrete statement in a book, and to hypothecate its translation
from one leader of thought to another, leaves out of
reckoning the possibility of ideas finding a place in individual
minds by means of a mystical faculty, or what is
commonly called revelation. This mystical faculty is the
power of sublimating ideas, a power, evolved from materialities,
that, at a certain stage of thought, produces a capacity
for abnormal insight into the nature of things, a capacity
that can be developed by training; that is to say, when the
faculty of knowledge becomes so far removed from the
mechanical influences of the brain that its connection with
the nervous system may be considered to be on the verge of
absolute severance. This faculty is due to no individualized
external power, but is simply a development from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
totality of things, their inherent qualities, their relationship
and interactions.</p>

<p>Both Philo and St. John may be credited with the possession
of a certain amount of this abnormal power, and considered
as presentations of Logos, but not in the same
perfection as Jesus and Gotama. "Bôdhi," Dr. Paul Carus
says, "is that which conditions the cosmic order of the
world and the uniformities of reality. Bôdhi is the everlasting
prototype of truth, partial aspects of which are
formulated by scientists in the various laws of nature.
Above all, Bôdhi is the basis of the Dharma; it is the
foundation of religion; it is the objective reality in the constitution
of being from which the good law of righteousness
is derived; it is the ultimate authority for moral conduct."</p>

<p>It is evident from historical sources that there were many
Buddhists living at and after the time of Gotama, when
traditions and legends accumulated, who had not assimilated
his doctrines in their entirety and purity. So it was in the
case of Jesus, whose followers and interpreters arrived at
various conclusions in respect of his teaching.</p>

<p>Some who have emancipated themselves from the "letter
that kills," and have acquired the power of grasping realities,
have conceived the true position of Jesus and Gotama to
have been that of clairvoyants, and, consequently, it is not
to be expected that a complete mastery of the meaning of
their communications would ever be attainable by ordinary
human knowledge. This latter conclusion, in respect of
Jesus, is most clearly established by passages to be found
in the New Testament.</p>

<p>Jesus and Gotama laboured under the same difficulty:
they knew more than was translatable into language, or communicable
to their followers. Parables were attempted as
media for imparting a glimmering of this knowledge to the
ignorant and obtuse. Professor Oldenberg says: "When we
try to resuscitate, in our own way and our own language, the
thoughts that are embedded in the Buddhist teaching, we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
can scarcely help forming the impression that it was not a
mere idle statement which the sacred texts present to us,
that the Perfect One knew much more which he thought
inadvisable to say than what he esteemed it profitable to
say."</p>

<p>Jesus withheld all explanation as to how evil came into
the world. He dealt with it as a fact. He did not even
theorize about the origin of evil. He taught, on the principle
of his well-known saying, "He that hath ears to hear
let him hear." "A careful regard to audience is traceable
in his use of apocalyptic language about his second coming;
it is to Jews only&mdash;the Twelve, or the high priest, or the
Sanhedrin, or Nathaniel, the 'Israelite indeed'&mdash;that he
speaks of cleft heavens, cloud chariots, and attendant
troops of angels. With the Roman governor he avoids
Jewish metaphors" (<cite>Encyclopædia Britannica</cite>, "Eschatology").</p>

<p>Both Jesus and Gotama must have realized the hopelessness
of imprinting their so-called esoteric teaching (which
underlay and intertwined with the ethical) upon the understanding
of those who had not cultivated noumenal
instincts. Gotama had need, even on his death-bed, to
explain everything all over again to his closest companion,
the beloved disciple Ananda. In how many ways Jesus
endeavoured to convey the meaning of the kingdom of God
to his hearers! Yet to this day how few have grasped a
fraction of its import. The meaning must be felt rather
than understood by the intellect. In fact, it is necessary to
become a Parsifal to do so ("for not many wise men after
the flesh are called"). Also, one must get as far as possible
away from the bondage of the intellect, which handicaps
one in the attempt. A full knowledge of such mysteries
cannot be attained until the machinery of the brain is left
a considerable distance behind; until ideas are no longer
in positive connection with the neural vibrations of the brain.
The clock cannot hear what is going on around it for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
noise of its ticking. Plotinus says: "To reach the ultimate
goal, thought itself must be left behind; for thought is a
form of motion, and the desire of the soul is for motionless
rest, which belongs to the One."</p>

<p>Neither Jesus nor Gotama committed themselves to
writing; hence we are entirely dependent, in our judgment
of the purport of their mission, upon the general tenour of
communications vouchsafed to us by the special correspondents
of their era. It is upon these synoptists and other
recorders that people build their theories, and pile up interpretations
in various very restricted senses.</p>

<p>But defining is truly dethroning in the cases of Jesus and
Gotama. Like the dove in the Song of Solomon, they
abide in the clefts of the rocks, in the secret places of the
stairs. The suppliant can only satisfy his thirsty soul with
an invocation: "Let me see thy countenance, let me hear
thy voice; for sweet is thy voice, and thy countenance is
comely!" Theism, Atheism, Deism, and many other 'isms
must be cast out of our minds into the bottomless pit before
we can hope to place our trembling feet within even the
threshold of their presence. There, perforce, we must
arrest our progress, lost in transcendent wonder. This, as
Carlyle says, is worship in its highest sense.</p>

<p>No allusion was made either by Jesus or Gotama to the
miraculous circumstances said to have attended their
nativity; and, although there exist no data for the assumption
that the historians of the latter were inspired writers
like those of the New Testament, the messianic halo with
which Buddhist tradition has encircled the figure of
Gotama tends to bring together the personalities of the two
reformers into closer pictorial relationship. But this
blending of the portraiture cannot be taken in any sense
as a help towards wheeling into line the psychological
forces in the field of inquiry. Nevertheless, the interest
attaching to these traditions as coincidental, and the consideration
that the date of the Buddhist chronicles is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
anterior to that of the New Testament, render them worthy
of brief notice.</p>

<p>M. Ernest de Bunsen<a name="FNanchor_H_8" id="FNanchor_H_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_H_8" class="fnanchor">[H]</a> says: "Among a circle of Indians
prophecies were accredited which announced the incarnation
of an angel, called the Anointed or Messiah, who
should bring to earth the Wisdom or Bôdhi from above,
and establish the kingdom of heavenly truth and justice.
He would be of royal descent, and genealogies would
connect him with his ancestors. The 'Blessed One,' the
'God among Gods,' and the 'Saviour of the World' was,
according to Buddhistic records, incarnate by the Holy
Ghost, of the royal Virgin Maya, and he was born on
Christmas Day, the birthday of the Sun, for which reason
the Sun became the symbol of Gotama Buddha. To
be like Gotama is to reach the ideal<a name="FNanchor_I_9" id="FNanchor_I_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_I_9" class="fnanchor">[I]</a> which has been
set to humanity, and to be like God. Salvation does not
depend on any outward act, but on a change or renewal of
the mind, or a reform of the inner nature, or faith in the
innate guiding power of God, of which the celestial Buddha,
incarnated in Gotama, was held to be the highest organ.
The saving faith, therefore, was brought by, and centred
in, the incarnate Angel-Messiah, the Saviour of the World.
Salvation is by faith, and faith comes by the Maya, the
Spirit or Word of God, of which Gotama, the Angel-Messiah,
was regarded as the divinely-chosen and incarnate messenger,
the Vicar of God, and God himself on earth.
According to Chinese-Buddhistic writings, it was the Holy
Ghost, or Shing-Su, which descended on the Virgin Maya.
The effect produced by this miracle is thus summed up in
the most ancient Chinese life of Buddha which we at
present possess, translated between <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 25 and 190: 'If
the child born from this conception be induced to lead a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
secular life, he shall become a universal monarch; but if he
leaves his home, and becomes a religious person, then he
shall become Buddha, and shall save the world.'"</p>

<p>Dr. Paul Carus, in his <cite>Buddhism and its Christian Critics</cite>,
pp. 150-51, says: "According to the orthodox Buddhist conception,
there is no doubt about it that the incarnation of
Buddha, in the person of Gotama Siddharta, has passed away.
Gotama has died, and his body will not be resurrected.
But Buddha continues to live in the body of the Dharma&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>,
the law or religion of Buddha; and, in so far as he is
the truth, he is immortal and eternal."</p>

<p>"The whole world may break to pieces, but Buddha will
not die. The words of Buddha are imperishable."</p>

<p>The idea of the appearance of a periodical Messiah was
extant throughout the Jaino-Buddhist times, thousands of
years before Gotama Buddha entered upon his mission in
the field of religious reformation. "Millions of Buddhists
still believe that their Lord will come again to redeem his
people, appearing as Maitri."<a name="FNanchor_J_10" id="FNanchor_J_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_J_10" class="fnanchor">[J]</a> The twenty-three Buddhas
who preceded Gotama&mdash;"the immortal saints universally
acknowledged by the Jains as coming to earth in divers ages
to aid and bless mankind"&mdash;have been recorded, with their
names, fathers' names, and symbols, reaching as far back, it
has been calculated, as 6,000 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> "The Blessed One said:
'The Buddha that will come after me will be known as
Maitrâiya, which means he whose name is Kindness.'"</p>

<p>The conception of a mystical Trinity was introduced into
both the Christian and Buddhist systems of belief at a late
stage of their development. In the case of Buddhism it
arose from the simple formula:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse"><span class="i0">"I take refuge in Buddha,<br /></span></div>
<div class="verse"><span class="i0">I take refuge in the Dharma,<br /></span></div>
<div class="verse"><span class="i0">I take refuge in the Sangha"&mdash;<br /></span></div>
</div></div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span></p>
<p>that is, in the Prophet, the Law, and the Church. These
afterwards were interpreted to stand for the Self-Existent,
the Son (Logos) or Sophia (Wisdom), and the Holy Ghost
(or uniting principle).</p>

<p>Gotama has also been said to possess three personalities,
and every one of them is of equal importance.<a name="FNanchor_K_11" id="FNanchor_K_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_K_11" class="fnanchor">[K]</a> "There
is the Dhârma Kâya; there is the Nirmâna Kâya; there is
the Sambhôga Kâya. <em>Buddha</em> is the all-excellent truth,
eternal, omnipresent, and immutable; this is the Sambhôga
Kâya, which is in a perfect state of bliss. <em>Buddha</em> is the
all-loving teacher, assuming the shape of the beings whom
he teaches; this is the Nirmâna Kâya, his apparitional body.
<em>Buddha</em> is the all-blessed dispensation of religion; he is the
spirit of the Sangha and the meaning of the commands
which he has left us in his sacred word, the Dhârma; this
is the Dhârma Kâya, the body of the most excellent law."</p>

<p>"It was proclaimed," says Mr. Lillie, "that Gotama
possessed a superfluity of good Karma, or Righteousness,
which was available for all men to partake of, whereby salvation
might be had." He quotes from the Bible as a parallel
to this idea: "By the righteousness of one the free gifts
came upon all men unto justification of life"; also: "By
the obedience of one shall many be made righteous."</p>

<p>To be saved by "the blood" in a realistic sense is another
way very much accentuated by St. Paul. To be saved
through "faith in the blood" has been taken to mean, by
some interpreters, through faith in the genealogy, or divine
stock, from which Jesus traced his descent, as well as
through "faith in the life" (which is the blood)&mdash;that is,
by following the life-example of the Son, in contradistinction
to the idea of salvation through a materialistic reliance on
the details of a violent death.</p>

<p>The doctrine of Predestination, which holds such a
prominent position in Christian theology, cannot be excluded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
altogether from a consideration of Buddhistic philosophy, in
which, however, it bears a somewhat different signification.
Although both Jesus and Gotama made use of the language
of "free-will" as we talk of to-morrow, which never is, one
is forced to conclude that, by virtue of their position as
manifestations of the Logos, they were both aware of the
scientific certainty of the non-existence of what is commonly
understood as "free-will." The very fact of the law of
causation being the pivot around which Buddhist philosophy
revolves seems to assure us that this was, in the
knowledge of Gotama, the central law of the Kosmos, and
such that it could not be affected by the will of an individual
who was not an independent individual, but simply
part and parcel of the molecular contents of the apparitional
world.</p>

<p>As Gotama recognized that the mind and sense of
humanity were so deeply ingrained with the notion of free-will,
he was constrained to use the <i lang="la">argumentum ad hominem</i>,
and outwardly base his ethical system on a free-will which
seemed natural to humanity to believe in, but which was
nevertheless a delusion.</p>

<p>The several passages in the New Testament in which the
doctrine of Predestination is plainly set forth are too well
known to necessitate their quotation here. St. Augustine
says: "What happens of thee he himself [God] works in
thee. Never anything happens of thee which he himself
does not work in thee.... Never is anything done by thee
unless he works it in thee."<a name="FNanchor_L_12" id="FNanchor_L_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_L_12" class="fnanchor">[L]</a></p>

<p>The universal feeling that we possess "free-will" is no
proof of its reality, and only on the basis of the axiom that
nothing is too unscientific or extraordinary to be possible
(which is sound enough) can it be accepted as a possibility.
Even Locke could not, for the life of him, reconcile omniscience
and free-will, although he believed in both.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span></p>

<p>Taking free-will as a sensation, we must pronounce it to
be just as illusory as any other sensation, except as a sensation.
On the other hand, the Determinist view cannot be
classified as a sensation, but is rather a product of reason.
Professor James says: "Genuine Determinism affirms, not
the impotence of free-will, but the unthinkability of free-will."</p>

<p>St. Paul writes, with reference to sin: "It is no more I
that do it, but sin (or evil Karma) that dwelleth in me."
And we are instructed in some parts of the Christian
Scripture that all good is of God, and not of ourselves.
Here, then, there appears to be a complete obliteration of
the idea of free-will in respect of actions either good, bad,
or indifferent; and in confirmation of this view it is necessary
to remember that the language of free-will was used for
convenience sake, that God is distinctly said "to have called
those things which be not as though they were." St. Paul
says: "The creature was made subject to vanity, not
willingly." Possibly he may have had in mind when he
delivered this dictum the vanity, or vain conceit, of assuming
free-will.</p>

<p>If it be permissible to assert that we exercise no control,
in the sense of free-will, over the functions of our digestive
organs, which perform their work without our being sensibly
conscious of it (except in the case of abnormal disturbance),
one would think the assertion might be extended in regard
to cerebral functions also. We conceive thought to precede
many of our actions, but if thought is the non-spatial
accompaniment of cerebral cell-action, and the latter is no
more amenable to the control of free-will than our digestive
organs are, then those actions which are the sequences of
thought cannot be "free-will" actions.</p>

<p>It is generally admitted that there are occasions when an
individual acts without exercising free-will; when, for
instance, a man loses his head, as the expression goes, in
a sudden catastrophe. There are also distinctly involuntary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
actions, such as blushing, turning pale, perspiring, etc.
It seems, then, that an individual only exercises his will,
according to general belief, under certain conditions. But
if free-will is acknowledged to be absent under some conditions,
may we not reasonably conclude that it may be
absent altogether, and only exists as an illusion of the
senses?</p>

<p>Anyhow, circumstances&mdash;or, in other words, the molecular
activities of the universe&mdash;appear to be the dominant factor
in determining our actions. These activities, when working
through cerebral cells, turn out thoughts; when operating
through the skin pores, they produce perspiration.</p>

<p>Locke, in his chapter on "Power" (human understanding),
seems to draw very near to an admission of Determinism,
but then flies away from it, evidently alarmed by
the spectre of irresponsibility. He labours to demonstrate
that uneasiness or desire determines the will to the successive
(so-called) voluntary actions whereof the greatest part
of our lives is made up, and by which we are <em>conducted</em>
through different causes to different ends. This is, as far
as it goes, unadulterated Determinism.</p>

<p>Dr. Paul Carus defines freedom of will as the power to
do that which one wills, not as the freedom of a man to
will what he wills. Indeterminism he declares to be based
upon error, because it attributes to man an exceptional
place in the universe. Man is supposed to be exempt from
the uniform and inexorable law of cause and effect which
rules in the universe. He says: "The decision of a free
man depends upon his character"; but character is only the
result of innumerable causes, which has become a cause
upon which other effects follow, according to the cosmic
law of causation, which must include in its impartial sway
man as well as all other integrations of matter.</p>

<p>Determinism is morally safe, because man cannot escape
from the <em>feeling</em> that he possesses free-will, which, nevertheless,
is an illusion, in the sense that "illusions are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
ideas that have not originated from the data of experience."</p>

<p>In <cite>Light</cite> (April 18th, 1898) there is quoted the following,
as part of a discourse on "The Evolution of Mind," delivered
by Professor Jordan: "The plant searches for food by a
movement of the feeding parts alone.... The tender tip is
the plant's brain. If locomotion were in question, the plant
would need to be differently constructed. It would demand
the mechanism of the animal. The nerve, brain, and
muscle of the plant are all represented by the tender growing
cells of the moving tips. The plant is touched by moisture
or sunlight. It 'thinks' of them, and in so doing the cells
that are touched and 'think' are turned towards the source
of the stimulus. The function of the brain, therefore, in
some sense exists in the tree, but there is no need in the
tree for a special sensorium."</p>

<p>A comment in <cite>Light</cite> on this discourse runs as follows:
"In higher organisms the mind becomes more and more
localized, until in the higher animals it has a special organ&mdash;the
brain, which, however, is shut up in darkness and 'has
no knowledge except such as comes to it from the sense-organs
through the ingoing or sensory nerves.' Being filled
with these impressions, some of which are actual sensations,
while others are memories of past sensations, <em>the brain must
make a choice</em> among them by fixation of attention, if it is to
act properly. To find data for such a choice is the function
of the intellect. This, Dr. Jordan tells us, is the difference
between mind and mere instinct, or inherited habits. Mind
chooses, instinct cannot, for it is but an automatic mind-process
inherited from generation to generation."</p>

<p>It must be remembered, however, that this faculty of
choosing, said to be possessed by the brain and acquired by
a process of development, is not free, but conditioned. The
terminal organs of the afferent nerves also may be said to
possess this faculty of choice, yet limited by their qualities
and the nature of the external influences to which they are
submitted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>

<p>The admission of a faculty of choice does not involve the
idea of absolute freedom, nor need it disturb the Buddhist
conception that there exists nothing behind the organism
in the shape of an ego-entity, or soul, which chooses or
remembers, and that there is no hidden agent which prompts
the conveyance of impressions.</p>

<p>If we admit this faculty of choice to be possessed by the
brain and terminal organs of the afferent and efferent nerves,
it simply involves the concession that the stored-up memories
in the brain, and the habits acquired by the muscular
organism, as results of past external influences, act in the
<em>manner</em> of choice; and in this sense only, it would seem,
can the notion of "freedom" be scientifically and logically
entertained.</p>

<p>If the faculty of choice, in this restricted sense, as the
possession of a pluricellular organism such as man, is
accepted in confirmation of the existence of "freedom,"
then we must accord the possession of "freedom" to the
simplest form of life. The cellule composed only of protoplasm
and a nucleus possesses the very same faculty.</p>

<p>M. Alfred Binet tells us of the highly-developed psychical
functions of the spermatozoid; how it searches out the
locality of the ovule situated at a distance; how, with a
sense of direction, it traverses the whole length of the intervening
space, overcoming all obstacles&mdash;which are many&mdash;in
its path, to attain the desired object; and he maintains
that such actions cannot be explained by simple irritability,
nor by chemical affinity. The brain may possess this
faculty, and the power to carry into effect the choice, as
qualities of its mechanism; but there is no discrete entity
behind the brain as agent.</p>

<p>"Is it quite certain that, when consciousness seems to
affirm that 'I can choose so and so,' it means more than 'it
is possible such and such a choice will take place in my
mind'? If it does not mean more than this, its affirmation
is not against Determinism" (<cite>Mind</cite>, April, 1898, p. 191).<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
Even if the faculty of choice is granted, it is limited in the
sense that choice does not always produce the effect chosen.</p>

<p>"Locke and Hume say 'Liberty is a power to act as <em>we</em>
choose.' But can <em>we</em> choose? Are <em>we</em> the original causes
of our choice? And what is the power to which action is
subjected? Must it not be subject to some other power,
and, therefore, not free, unless it is a self-existent power?"</p>

<p>Enough has been said, perhaps, on this subject to explain
the author's position in assuming that both Jesus and
Gotama must have been, by necessity of their omniscience,
well aware of the truth of Determinism. Yet, having to
deal with phenomenal beings, they were constrained to treat
them as such, and address them in phenomenal terms, and
to lower themselves to the level of those sensations from
which the illusive and unconquerable feeling of responsibility
arises.</p>

<p>The fact of occult powers having been attributed to
Jesus and Gotama makes it necessary to include in this
chapter a brief reference to the subject of magic,<a name="FNanchor_M_13" id="FNanchor_M_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_M_13" class="fnanchor">[M]</a> and to
consider in what light we should regard this art in connection
with these two characters.</p>

<p>It has been remarked that the opposition to magic has
seldom been connected with sceptical doubts as to its
reality, and that the distinction drawn between white and
black magic was due to the assumption by the priestly class
of the sole right to the exercise of magic in their rites, and
"hence magicians who were outside the pale of priesthood
were called sorcerers, or dealers in black magic." The
pages of the Christian Bible are aflame with magic, and,
on opening the Old Testament, one seems to stand on the
threshold of an unmeasurable cavern, where dreams the
Great Magician that inhabiteth Eternity.</p>

<p>No one who has not made of magic, in its several<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
branches, a close study&mdash;who has not literally soaked in
mysticism (that "powerful solvent of definite dogma")&mdash;or
who is not gnomic, intuitionally "in the know" without
study, can possibly pose as an authoritative interpreter of
God's Holy Word.</p>

<p>An authority on the Hermetic Philosophy says that
astrology is to be found "throughout the Bible, from the
very first chapter of Genesis, when the stars were set for
<em>signs</em> and seasons and days and years, on to the Book of
Revelation, where the wonder was seen in heaven, the
woman clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet,
and all the great astrological problems in that book; and
the great truth, the Incarnation itself, announced by the
star of the Epiphany.... All the occult methods of divination
more or less find their place in the Bible and in the
scheme of religion. The divination by Urim and Thummin
is a well-known form of clairvoyance which is practised
now. Joseph's divining-cup was merely a species of magic
mirror, the form of which is well known now, and is used
by some clairvoyant seers. The use of music by the
prophet Elisha, when the kings of Israel and Judah went
out against Moab, is precisely the same as is now used by
many Spiritualist mediums and seers, though not with the
same effect ordinarily. And so one might go on with all the
forms of divination. It can be clearly proved that divination
by cards was known and practised in Biblical times by
the Biblical prophets; all this showing that during the times
of the Old Testament, and with <em>commendation</em> from the
prophets, and in use by the prophets, were modes of divination
which postulated the truth of the Hermetic science."</p>

<p>It stands to reason that Jesus as God, and Gotama as
Buddha, must have been acquainted with all the laws of
nature, and, consequently, were in full possession of so-called
occult powers. The manifestations of these powers
enter more largely and distinctly, as true records, into the
life of Jesus than into that of Gotama. The acts of Jesus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
were one continuous demonstration of occult power, and
his disciples were, in a lesser degree, gifted with the same
powers.</p>

<p>That which is known as ceremonial magic was not made
use of to any extent by Jesus and Gotama as a method or
means for the production of these powers. This was not
requisite with them, as it is in the case of ordinary individuals,
who must have recourse to those aids which have
been found by occultists, after long experience, to be the
most efficient means of attaining their object.</p>

<p>Clumsier methods have been used with a minimum amount
of success; but, if the operator desires to arrive at any
degree of perfection in the art, it is just as necessary for
him to observe closely the rules laid down by the ceremonialists
of magic as it is for a gamekeeper to make use
of the accepted symbolism in the training of a retriever&mdash;that
is, if the object is to accomplish the undertaking with
the least trouble and the best results. Jesus and Gotama,<a name="FNanchor_N_14" id="FNanchor_N_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_N_14" class="fnanchor">[N]</a>
on account of their unique position as being <i lang="fr">en rapport</i> with
this power, had no occasion, therefore, to resort to ceremonial
magic.</p>

<p>The Indian saint Mozoomdar (whose acquaintance I had
the privilege of making in India), in his introductory remarks
to <cite>The Oriental Christ</cite>, a book published by him in 1883,
points out how estimates of character vary if viewed from
different standpoints, and how, when the singularity of a
nature happens to lie in its manysidedness, representations
of it may be conflicting, but quite genuine and correct. The
whole of the introduction to this work shows such remarkable
and original insight into the character of Jesus, as
judged from an Oriental point of view, that I cannot forbear
to give a few quotations, more especially as they may tend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
to help forward the purpose of this chapter by demonstrating
how the personalities of Jesus and Gotama are interchangeable
under certain aspects in respect of their mystic significance.</p>

<p>Early in the introduction the writer says: "It is held
that the celestial figure of the sweet Prophet of Nazareth is
illumined with strange and unknown radiance when the
light of Oriental faith and <em>mystic</em> devotion is allowed to fall
upon it. It is a fact that the greatest religions of the world
have sprung from Asia. It has, with some accuracy, been
said, therefore, that it is an Asiatic only who can teach
religion to Asiatics. In Christ we see not only the exaltedness
of humanity, but also the grandeur of which Asiatic
nature is susceptible."</p>

<p>In the following very plain terms he distinguishes Christ
as the Logos of the Gospel of St. John, with which may be
classified the "Bodhi," or Intelligence of the Buddhists:
"He was the thought and energy of God. He was the plan
of God. He was the light of divine reason and love, as
yet involved within the great impenetrable. In that
sense the whole universe was at one time merely the
thought of the Infinite Being. And every one of us has
sprung from the formless ocean of divinity that spread
through all."</p>

<p>"John the Baptist," he writes, "had announced the
kingdom of heaven. Jesus pointed to it. Pointed
where?... He pointed to the kingdom of heaven in his own heart.
He pointed to the inner sphere where his disembodied
spirit communed with the eternal spirit of life; and, beholding
God in him and himself in God, he exclaimed: 'I and
my Father are one.'... He also beheld his brethren in him,
and cried: 'Abide in me, and I in you.'"</p>

<p>This, the writer says, is pure Idealism, and Christ even
idealized his flesh and blood, and administered them to his
disciples as a sacrament.</p>

<p>Finally, this enraptured saint of Hindustan places
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
before the reader two characters in illustration of the distinctions
which may be said to exist between Eastern and
Western conceptions of Jesus: "One of them is an elaborately
learned man, versed in all the principles of theology.
His doctrine is historical, exclusive, and arbitrary.... He
insists upon plenary inspiration, becomes stern over forms,
continually descants on miracles ... condemns men to
eternal darkness and death. He continually talks of blood
and fire and hell ... he hurls invectives at other men's
faith.... All scriptures are false which have grown up outside
of his dispensation, climate, and authority.... He is
tolerated only because he carries with him the imperial
prestige of a conquering race. Can this be the Christ that
will save India?</p>

<p>"By his side another figure. He is simple, natural. He
is a stranger to the learning of books. Out of the profound,
untaught impulses of his soul he speaks.... His doctrines
are the simple utterances of a fatherhood which embosoms
all the children of men, and a brotherhood which makes all
the races of the world one great family.... All nations
respond to his mystical utterances about heaven and earth....
His self-immersed air, absent eyes ... which show
that his spirit is far, far away, point him out to be the
Prophet of the East, the sweet Jesus of the Galilean lake.</p>

<p>"Throughout the whole Eastern world the perfume of
his faith and devotion has spread. The wild genius of
Mohammed knew and adored him amid the sands of Arabia.
The tender, love-intoxicated soul of Hafiz revelled in the
sweetness of Christ's piety amid the rosebuds and nightingales
of Persia. Look at this picture and upon that....
When we speak of an Eastern Christ we speak of the incarnation
of unbounded love and grace; and when we speak
of a Western Christ, we speak of the incarnation of theology,
formalism, ethical, and physical force. Christ, we know, is
neither of the East nor of the West; but men have localized
what God meant to make universal."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span></p>

<p>Happily there is no need to substantiate the fact of the
immense consolations derived by humanity from the Christian
mode of regarding the past, the present, and the future,
with all its dazzling possibilities, in the direction of a New
Jerusalem; but it must, indeed, seem strange to those
nurtured amid Christian influences that a religious system
such as Buddhism, which does not recognize a God or Soul
or Immortality in the Occidental sense of these terms, should
claim to have as its product that <i lang="fr">c&#339;ur léger</i> temperament
which is said to be, and to have been, the distinctive
characteristic of its countless adherents.</p>

<p>When the mind wanders afar from the dogmatic of the
scholiast, the life of Jesus presents itself with a dramatic
force of loveliness and grandeur which, of its kind, cannot
be surpassed; and the poetic pathos of the New Testament,
though not so resonant as that to be found in the pages of
such works as Job and the Prophets, possesses a pastoral
charm of its own at once soothing and stimulating.</p>

<p>In Buddhistic literature, and in the intensity of Buddhistic
thoughts, there are extraordinary and unrivalled beauties
which are emphasized in a remarkable manner, in the sympathetic
rendering accorded to them by such exponents as
Professor Oldenberg and Mr. Lafcadio Hearn. One must
be insensitive to a degree if such writers and interpreters of
Buddhism do not succeed in striking a chord of overwhelming
harmony throughout the system.</p>

<p class="center">GOD AND THE KOSMOS.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="center">"Differences veil a fundamental unity."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Bruno.</span></p></blockquote>
<hr class="small" />

<p>Both Christianity and Buddhism can be set to the same
music, the music of the unconditioned. The definition of
the Christian God as invisible and eternal, and as that
which has not parts, body, or passions, is incontestably an
attempt to convert our thoughts to a belief in, and appreciation
of, the unconditioned. The entire teaching of Jesus
moves in this direction; and this will be recognized at once
if we permit ourselves to interpret his symbolic utterances
in the right and only logical sense. To be saved&mdash;that is,
to realize the unconditioned&mdash;we must believe in Jesus;
namely, in his teaching.</p>

<p>If humanity could assume this attitude of mind&mdash;if it
could attune its thoughts to what Christian symbolism really
means, or ought to mean&mdash;then all the magnificent ritual of
the Holy Catholic Church, the realistic hymnology, even
the shibboleths of the Salvationist, would no longer give
rise to the supercilious contempt of the so-called intellectual
world, but would everywhere be recognized as the expression
of the most exalted philosophy, and consonant with the
latest results of psycho-physiological research. "The proud
have held me exceedingly in derision, yet have I not
shrinked from thy law." Everything that teaches us that
the end of all things and the goal of all men is a complete
realization of the "unconditioned" is the acceptable word
of God.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span></p>

<p>Gotama, using a symbolism of his own, and by means of
parables not wholly dissimilar to those employed by Jesus,
taught the self-same truth. The flesh has to be crucified&mdash;that
is, the idea of separateness has to be eliminated&mdash;and
then only will Heaven, Nirvana, at-oneness with the
unproduced (with God), be a reality.</p>

<p>It is legitimate to speak of Jesus as God, and Gotama is
known as Buddha. Here we have, then, Jesus-God and
Gotama-Buddha. But God and Buddha are but two
different terms used for the expression of one identical idea.
The recognition of "Buddha" as an equivalent for "God"
has been very generally ignored by interpreters of Buddhism;
hence the confusion of thought which has existed in this
connection. This in some measure may also be due to the
fact that Gotama, in preaching to the Brahmins, made use
of the word "Brahma" to denote God.</p>

<p>Jesus and Gotama were gnomic, or divinely wise&mdash;that is,
they <em>knew</em> of the "unconditioned." They both ardently
desired to communicate this knowledge to the world, and
the way of escape from absolute bondage to the conditioned
to a realization of the unconditioned. If, knowing the way,
man still elects to continue in bondage to the conditioned
state, in a hell of misery or through a series of incarnations,
he can do so by disregarding the injunction, "Set not your
affections on things on earth."</p>

<p>Gotama pointed out the <em>straight</em> path that leads to a
union with Brahma (God); but there was also a circuitous
path indicated by him, by which we can make "golden
stairways of our weaknesses." To the different symbolism
employed by Gotama, and the meaning attached to this
symbolism by his exponents, may also be attributed the
failure of many acquainted only with the outlines of
Buddhism to assimilate the term "Buddha" with that of
"God" in its universalist sense.</p>

<p>When we come to a careful and impartial study of the
Gospel of Buddha, it is astonishing what a close connection<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
is to be found therein between the God idea of the Christian
community and the Buddha idea of the Asiatic world.
Gotama does not, as many suppose, exclude the notion of
God as that of all-pervading Love. "The whole wide
world," he says, "above, below, around, and everywhere,
will continue to be filled with Love, far-reaching, grown
great and beyond measure." "Buddha is the all-loving
teacher, assuming the shape of the beings whom he
teaches." This is the second person of the Buddhist triad,
the apparitional body of Gotama.</p>

<p>The splendid symbolism of the holy, blessed, and glorious
Trinity, three persons and one God, common to both Christianity
and Buddhism, falls like the cloudy hangings of a
gorgeous sunset between us and the unconditioned. Many
of the spectators are held spellbound and enslaved by the
beauty of the phenomena alone; a few see its meaning, and
realize the noumenon. The symbol is, as it were, a yearning
of the visible to suggest the invisible, the conditioned
speaking to us of the unconditioned. The small minority&mdash;the
Blessed Ones, the Arhats of Buddhism, the saints of
Christendom&mdash;they are those who know the Lord, who see
God. Yet there remains for every being a sure hope of the
deathless life.</p>

<p>After many a weary round of births and deaths or long
sojourns in Purgatory, after many a climb up the dark ladder
of life, every being at last will reach the desired goal, and
see the fulfilment of prophecy when God will <em>be</em> all and
<em>in</em> all.</p>

<p>A great Orientalist has pronounced Buddhism to be the
most godless of all heathen religions. If this assertion
means that the god of the heathens is anthropomorphic and
that of the Buddhists is not so, then the statement of this
distinguished scholar, though a little staggering at first sight,
may be regarded as containing an element of truth, but not
the whole truth.</p>

<p>The question whether the true Buddhism of Gotama<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
recognized a god in any sense of the expression still exercises
the minds of controversialists. At the very outset of
our inquiry into the Buddhistic conception of a god or no-god,
we are confronted by directly conflicting conclusions
arrived at by two eminent authorities. Professor Rhys
Davids regards the true Buddhism of Gotama to be nothing
but blank Atheism, whereas Mr. Arthur Lillie unflinchingly
pronounces it to be Theism <i lang="fr">pur et simple</i>.</p>

<p>In my judgment, all the controversy that rages around
the Hinayâna<a name="FNanchor_O_15" id="FNanchor_O_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_O_15" class="fnanchor">[O]</a> and the Mahayâna, which represent respectively
the Southern and Northern schools of thought, only
confuses the issue; and the opinions of sectarian Buddhists,
or even the edicts of Asoka, cannot, I think, be accepted in
themselves as directly supporting any hard-and-fast theory
regarding the Theistic or Atheistic tendencies in the teaching
of Gotama.</p>

<p>With reference to the evidence of the edicts, it must not
be overlooked that Asoka figured as a good Theist while
Viceroy at Ujain, and for some years subsequent to his
becoming Emperor of India&mdash;a fact which several of his
edicts, I believe, confirm.</p>

<p>A God, one Person (yet three Persons in One), without
body (yet walks), without parts (yet seen), without passions
(yet with compassion), a spirit, an indefinable, an illocatable,
incomprehensible substance in which we live and move and
have our being, that cannot be known, yet can be found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
(those that seek after me shall find me), which some people
have beautifully symbolized as a loving Father and others
have debased into a jealous and vindictive tyrant&mdash;of such
a God only, as an eternally conditionless mystery, it can
surely be established, from a review of Buddhistic evidence,
that it is not, and has not been, totally ignored.</p>

<p>It is difficult to see the force of denoting God as super-personal
or super-anything. He or It is personal, and
everything else as masked by materialities, and in the sense
of all things being his contents. Particles of matter are the
contents of form. Form cannot be manifest without matter.
God is pure or shapeless form, as well as the formative
power of form.</p>

<p>Dr. Paul Carus, in referring to the God idea of the
Buddhists, says: "No religion can exist without belief in
the existence of an ultimate authority of conduct; but in
this sense Buddhism, too, teaches a belief in God. The
Abhidharma, or Buddhist philosophy, distinctly rejects the
idea of a creation by an Ishvara&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, a personal creator;
but it recognizes that all deeds, be they good or evil, will
bear fruit according to their nature, and they teach that this
law, which is ultimately identical with the law of cause and
effect, is an irreversible reality; that there are no exceptions
or deviations from it. Thus law takes, to some extent, the
place of the God idea, and Buddhists gain a personal
attitude to it, similarly as Christians do when speaking of
God, in quite a peculiar way. The doctrine of the Trikâya,
or the three bodies, teaches us that Buddha has three
personalities. The first one is the Dharma-Kâya, or the body
of the law; it corresponds to the Holy Ghost in the Christian
dogmatology. The second personality is the Nirmâna-Kâya,
or the body of transformations; it is transient in its
various forms, and its most important and latest appearance
has been Gotama Siddhârta. This corresponds to the
second person of the Christian Trinity, to God the Son, or
Christ.... The third personality of Buddha is called<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
Sambhoga-Kâya, or the body of bliss. It is the Christian
idea of God the Father. Buddha, in his capacity as Sambhoga-Kâya,
is described as eternal, omnipresent, and
omnipotent. He is the life of all that lives, and the reality
of all that exists. Thus he is the All in All, in whom we
live and move and have our being."<a name="FNanchor_P_16" id="FNanchor_P_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_P_16" class="fnanchor">[P]</a></p>

<p>General Forlong, in his <cite>Short Studies in the Science of
Comparative Religion</cite>, informs us that "the first great
Hindu Creating Father was a real Praj&#257;-pati, 'Lord of
Creations'&mdash;a true Hermaik Brahm&#257;; and, being depicted
as a potent masculine Zeus, like to Yahvê, Chemosh,
Amon, etc., he in time naturally became distasteful to
cultured and pious philosophic minds searching after a <em>great
ideal</em>, and no magnified man, solar or royal governor. As
did Vedantists, so have others developed a <em>great neuter
Brahm</em>; even pious Christian philosophers have sought,
and some few dared to own, a Brahm, despite the direct
anthropomorphic teaching of the Christian and Hebrew
Scriptures. Thus the Rev. Principal Caird, D.D. (Glasgow
University), boldly says, in his Gifford Lectures, 1895-6,
that in his view 'Christianity knows no such thing as a
First Cause, or an Omnipotent Creator and moral governor
of the world, a being framed after the image of man, an
anthropomorphic potentate seated on a celestial throne and
dispensing rewards after the manner of an earthly sovereign
or magistrate.'"</p>

<p>It is remarkable to find a parallel conception of Law, as
associated by Buddhists with the idea of divinity prevailing
among the Egyptians, who "recognized a divinity in those
cases only when they perceived the presence of a fixed Law,
either of permanence or of change. This <em>regularity</em>, which
is the constitutive character of the Egyptian divinity, was
called Ma&#257;t. Ma&#257;t is, in fact, the Law and Order by which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
the universe exists. Truth and Justice are but forms of
Ma&#257;t as applied to human action."<a name="FNanchor_Q_17" id="FNanchor_Q_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_Q_17" class="fnanchor">[Q]</a></p>

<p>In Mr. Arthur Lillie's book, <cite>The Influence of Buddhism
on Primitive Christianity</cite>, there is struck a note of playfulness
which almost leads one to suppose that the writer does
not intend that he should be taken seriously everywhere in
his fascinating pages. This is apparent even in his treatment
of the Jewish conception of an Almighty ruler, when
he takes for his text (Judges i. 19): "The Lord was with
Judah, and He drove out the inhabitants of the mountains,
but <em>could not</em> drive out the inhabitants of the valley because
they had chariots of iron." In a similar spirit in this connection
he would probably handle rather roughly the notion
of omniscience.</p>

<p>Mr. Lillie, further on in his book, quotes a conversation
that is said to have taken place between Gotama and some
Brahmins on the subject of ultimate union with the Eternal
Brahma. Gotama points out that all their talk about union
is foolish talk, because they know nothing about him. But
this does not necessarily imply, as one would gather from
the commentary, that Gotama knew nothing of a Brahma,
or quality of the kosmos or Buddha, which was indefinable,
and could only be adumbrated in language, and no more.
His sole intention, it seems to me, was to impress on his
audience that this Brahma could not be approached by a
factitious asceticism, and that all speculations as to his
nature and origin would be mere waste of time and energy.
Subsequently, on p. 83, Gotama is made to refer to this
Brahma as a non-Theistic "It"&mdash;evidently the neuter
Brahm&mdash;the absolute, or the great "I am" of the Christian
Bible.</p>

<p>Here I would refer <i lang="fr">en passant</i> to the following passage
which occurs on p. 84: "There are two schools of Buddhism,
and they are quite agreed in this, that Buddhism is
the quickening of the spiritual vision."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span></p>

<p>This, Buddhistically understood, is true enough, but there
is a danger of the Christian reader associating with the
expression "spiritual" the idea of the existence of a spirit
in man as an ego-entity. Interpreted in this sense, the
expression would be wholly inapplicable to any possible
phase of Buddhistic thought or doctrine. Gotama knew of
no independent spirit-entity in man, so there could be no
such thing as animistic vision in Buddhism.</p>

<p>In the New Testament it is evident from the context that
Jesus, when negatively describing a spirit as that which hath
not flesh and bones, was not alluding to spirit in the sense
given to it by modern psychologists as "ideas," or as applied
to the Sankhâras by the translator of Professor Oldenberg's
book on Buddhism, but had in view those presentations of
matter of human shape, without flesh and bone development,
the appearance of which from time to time has been
confirmed by not a few rational and reliable people.</p>

<p>With reference to Mr. Lillie's comments on the Jewish
conception of an Almighty Ruler, it may be remarked here
that <em>executive</em> omnipotence and omniscience convey the
notion of qualities that cannot be philosophically applied to
the absolute as conceived by Brahmins. This is very clearly
enunciated in the philosophy of the Upanishads.</p>

<p>Mr. A. E. Gough, in his book on this subject, writes:
"The Self (Brahma, or Reality) is said to be omniscient,
but the reader must not be misled; this only means that it
is self-conscious.... The omniscience of the Reality is its
irradiation of all things."</p>

<p>It (Reality) knows but knows nothing, it sees but sees
nothing, it loves but loves nothing; because "It" is knowledge,
sight, love, etc. It transcends the relation of subject
and object. In the New Testament we meet with the
expression, "God is love"&mdash;that is, a quality with no objective
application. It is the unseen and eternal in contradistinction
to the seen and temporal.</p>

<p>"Brahma is Beatitude. But we must be cautious.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
Brahma is not Beatitude in the ordinary sense of the term.
It is a bliss beyond the distinction of subject and object....
The Indian philosophers everywhere affirm that Brahma is
knowledge, not that Brahma has knowledge."<a name="FNanchor_R_18" id="FNanchor_R_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_R_18" class="fnanchor">[R]</a></p>

<p>This is very like Schelling's idea as portrayed in his
account of the ultimate goal of the finite ego: "The ultimate
goal of the finite ego is enlargement of its sphere till
the attainment of identity with the infinite ego. But the
infinite ego knows no object, and possesses, therefore, no
consciousness or unity of consciousness, such as we mean
by personality. Consequently, the ultimate goal of all
endeavour may also be represented as enlargement of the
personality to infinity&mdash;that is to say, as its annihilation.
The ultimate goal of the finite ego, and not only of it, but
also of the non-ego&mdash;the final goal, therefore, of the world&mdash;is
its annihilation as a world."<a name="FNanchor_S_19" id="FNanchor_S_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_S_19" class="fnanchor">[S]</a></p>

<p>Mr. Gough, in the book already referred to, remarks
"that Buddhism is the philosophy of the Upanishads with
Brahma left out; that in Buddhism Brahma, or the inner
light, is replaced by zero, or a vacuum; that there is no
light of lights beyond the darkness of the world-fiction; that
the highest end and final hope of man is a return into this
vacuum, or aboriginal nothingness of things. This is Nirvana,
the extinction of the soul; the path to it is the path of
inertion, apathy, and vacuity."</p>

<p>Buddhism expounded in this fashion is likely to produce
a very erroneous conception of what it really proves to be.</p>

<p>In the first place, such expressions as "vacuum," "emptiness,"
"voidness," must not be interpreted solely in a
negative sense; there is a positive sense also to be taken
into account. The positive aspect of such expressions has
been very clearly set forth by the great Chinese philosopher,
Lau-toze, in the following manner: "The thirty spokes
unite in the one nave, but it is on the empty space (for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
axle) that the use of the wheel depends. Clay is fashioned
into vessels, but it is on their empty hollowness that their
use depends. The door and windows are cut out (from the
walls) to form an apartment, but it is on the empty space
(within) that its use depends. Therefore, what has a
(positive) existence serves for positive adaptation, and what
has not that for (actual) usefulness."<a name="FNanchor_T_20" id="FNanchor_T_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_T_20" class="fnanchor">[T]</a></p>

<p>Secondly, although Gotama preached a kind of quietism,
it was not the quietism of inertion and apathy. He exhorted
his followers to vigorous activity in the acquisition of knowledge:
"He who does not rouse himself when it is time to
rise, who, though young and strong, is full of sloth, whose
will and thought are weak, that lazy and idle man will never
find the way to knowledge (enlightenment). If anything
is to be done, let a man do it; let him attack it vigorously."<a name="FNanchor_U_21" id="FNanchor_U_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_U_21" class="fnanchor">[U]</a></p>

<p>Mr. Gough says that to gain this extinction the sage
must loose himself from every tie and turn his back upon
the world.</p>

<p>This is very much akin to the way in which a Christian
must act, according to the teaching of the New Testament,
if he would gain heaven, union with God, with Love, with a
quality. But it would be doing injustice to the spirit of
Christianity and Buddhism to describe their ultimate goals
as annihilation, aboriginal nothingness, and extinction, and
the path to it as one of inertion, apathy, and vacuity, in the
ordinary sense of these terms.</p>

<p>The expression "annihilation" has much to answer for.
It has been flaunted scornfully in the face of Buddhism by
Vedantists of bygone ages and by Christians of this century;
it has been hurled from pulpits with tremendous vehemence
into the ears of bewildered congregations, and it has formed
a text for delighted and triumphant denunciation in innumerable
articles&mdash;in fact, with annihilation inscribed on its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
banners, the whole host of Buddha's army has been
depicted as marching inevitably to utter and irretrievable
ruin.</p>

<p>At this juncture let us turn to a later authority, Mr.
Lafcadio Hearn, who, in answer to the question, What
remains to rise above all forms and the total disintegration
of body and final dissolution of the mind? sets forth the
Buddhist conception in the following manner: "Unconsciously
dwelling behind the false consciousness of imperfect
man&mdash;beyond sensation, perception, thought&mdash;wrapped in
the envelope of what we call soul (which, in truth, is only a
thickly-woven veil of illusion), is the eternal and divine, the
absolute Reality; not a soul, not a personality, but the All-self
without selfishness&mdash;the <em>Muga no Taiga</em>&mdash;the Buddha
enwombed in Karma. Within every phantom-self dwells
this divine; yet the innumerable are but one. Within
every creature incarnate sleeps the Infinite Intelligence,
unevolved, hidden, unfelt, unknown, yet destined from all
the eternities to waken at last, to rend away the ghostly web
of sensuous mind, to break for ever its chrysalis of flesh,
and pass to the supreme conquest of Space and Time."<a name="FNanchor_V_22" id="FNanchor_V_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_V_22" class="fnanchor">[V]</a></p>

<p>There is no doubt, as General Forlong informs us in his
<cite>Short Studies in the Science of Comparative Religions</cite>, that
Buddha's followers "finally revered him as a god, mixing up
the first high and pure teaching of his faith with all the
varied old and new doctrines, rites, and follies peculiar to
each race and land which developed it. Every religion has
to submit to this ordeal."</p>

<p>It cannot be too often reiterated that a personal moral
ruler of the universe, "a gigantic shadow thrown upon the
void of space by the imagination," or a sublimated edition
of man located in the sky, is entirely foreign to true Buddhism;
and, although Gotama deprecated as futile all
speculations into the ultimate origin of things, he, in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
"Buddha" capacity, was aware of the theory of an uncaused
cause, whether called "Akâsa" or "Dzyu," or anything
else, from which everything has issued in obedience
to a law of motion inherent in it.<a name="FNanchor_W_23" id="FNanchor_W_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_W_23" class="fnanchor">[W]</a> This uncaused cause
has its counterpart in the incomprehensible Uncreate of the
Athanasian Creed. It is the God without and the kingdom
of heaven within. A Buddha and It are one.</p>

<p>In the "White Lotus of Dharma" Gotama is made to
declare that, though in the form of a Buddha, he is in reality
the Self-existent.<a name="FNanchor_X_24" id="FNanchor_X_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_X_24" class="fnanchor">[X]</a> On the other hand, from a purely
phenomenal point of view, "a Buddha is simply a very wise
man, and means 'The Awakened.'"</p>

<p>"Buddha, as a Buddha, knew all about the ultimate origin
of the Kosmos. The personal Buddha, however, abstained
from any such speculations, holding that, for the purposes
of practical ethics, the wise man not only may, but must,
avoid the distraction of speculation as to any ultimate cause"
(Rev. Spence Hardy). "Self-conquest and universal charity,
these are the foundation thoughts, the web and woof of
Buddhism, the melodies on the variations of which its
enticing harmony is built up" (Professor Rhys Davids).
Such, too, according to the Christian Scriptures, is religion,
pure and undefiled, before God and the Father.</p>

<p>The Rev. A. Sherring points out how the success of
Gotama in overcoming the forces opposed to him "is
unparalleled in human history.... That a solitary man,
prince and ascetic, after pondering for five years over all
the great doctrines of religions, priestcraft, falsities, the
immoralities, shams, and confusions of those times, and the
groans and miseries of his countrymen, that he should devise
an entirely new system, think it out, and put it in order to
meet objectors and overcome their arguments, and then go
forth to the gradual conquest of India, and send forth mis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>sionaries
who have converted 500 millions of people&mdash;that
all this was the ultimate result of that one man's energy,
sagacity, and resoluteness of will is assuredly one of the
most astounding events in the annals of the world. He
was a simple philosopher, reasoner, and calm disputant,
employing no physical force whatever; while the morality
which he enforced was the purest the world ever saw."
General Forlong, in quoting this passage, says: "Such,
divested of a few professional words, is the deliberate
opinion of one of the best, the most learned and experienced
missionaries."</p>

<p>Professor Rhys Davids seems to level a shaft at the typical
Christian when he says that the Buddhist saint does not
mar the purity of his self-denial by lusting after a positive
happiness in a world to come; nor, it might be added, does
the essential Christian who realizes the kingdom of heaven
within.</p>

<p>If we take the word "God" in a restricted anthropomorphic
sense, and the word "soul" to mean an entity
that survives the body, it will appear strange to many, as
Professor Rhys David says, that a religion which ignores the
existence of such a God, and denies the existence of such
a soul, should be the very religion which has found most
acceptance among men. The same authority remarks that
of any immaterial existence Buddhism knows nothing.
This is true if "immaterial" or "spiritual" is taken to
mean something altogether divorced from matter.</p>

<p>The universe, according to Buddhism, is not merely an
arrangement of matter into forms and substances, but it
consists also of the qualities of matter, and the relationship
of the different particles and qualities to each other. The
philosophy of Buddhism, in this connection, is Monism,
which is described by its exponents as "a unitary world-conception,
but not a one-substance theory. It does not
imply that the world consists either of matter alone or of
spirit alone, or that all its phenomena are motions only;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
but that our concepts of spiritual, material, mechanical, and
other processes are abstractions, representing special features
of reality; reality itself being one inseparable and indivisible
entirety."</p>

<p>The phenomenal is a mode of the noumenal, as heat is
a mode of motion. "<em>Ex</em>-istence" is a mode of "istence."
There is no "beyond," no "behind the veil"; it is all one.
If we take, as a provisional analogy, the flower of a tree to
be the noumenal, and the root the phenomenal, they are
both&mdash;as belonging to the tree&mdash;the same, and yet not the
same. The soul might be likened to the blossom at the
apex, at a point farthest away from the earth. The more
perfect this soul-blossom becomes, the nearer it approaches
the possibility of entering upon the unconditioned as
immortal beauty&mdash;</p>

<p>and becoming thereby identical with truth.</p>

<p>Many people assign to music a power, exceeding that of
all other arts, of sublimating the emotions of the human
heart. Altering somewhat the form of the definition of
Poetry as given by Theodore Watts, in his article on the
subject in the <cite>Encyclopædia Britannica</cite>, one might say that
absolute music is the <em>non</em>-concrete and artistic expression
of the human mind in emotional and rhythmical sounds.
The state of the mind under the influence of music has been
compared to a "sea of emotion&mdash;uncurdled by thoughts."
This mental condition may also be super-induced, I think,
by means of sculpture, painting, and poetry. In fact, I
would maintain that the success of an artist, whether he
be musician, poet, or painter, must always be measurable
by his power of suggesting the unconditioned, or of bringing
the human mind as near as possible to a <em>thoughtless</em> state of
emotion, and, finally, to that of non-emotion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span></p>

<p>In the gospel according to Buddha it is written:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse"><span class="i0">"There lurks in transient form immortal bliss."<br /></span></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>The true artist can cause this immortal bliss to be felt, in
all its Nirvanic beauty, by those naturally susceptible to
such influences, as well as by those who, by a course of
training, have rendered themselves capable of receiving
them.</p>

<p>There is no line of demarcation between the noumenal
and phenomenal. The one fades into the other, as all
forms and outlines would disappear into the surrounding
atoms or cosmic dust under a sufficiently powerful magnifying
glass. "Appearance (the world of phenomena) is the
real, as confusedly and partially understood.... The real is
the apparent completely understood, and seen in the light
of the whole.... Appearance is the appearance of reality....
If we know 'only phenomena,' we must thereby know
<em>something</em> of that of which they are phenomena."<a name="FNanchor_Y_25" id="FNanchor_Y_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_Y_25" class="fnanchor">[Y]</a></p>

<p>According to Buddhistic teaching, there are two worlds,
so to speak&mdash;the one ruled by the law of causality, the other
over which the law of causality has no power. A Buddhist
would say that "the man who applies to the strictly unconditioned
predicates such as being and non-being, which are
used properly enough of the finite, the conditioned, resembles
one who attempts to count the sands of the Ganges
or the drops of the ocean."</p>

<p>With much the same sort of reasoning Jesus referred to
the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven when addressing
those who had eyes and did not see, and ears and did not
hear.</p>

<p>In view of the apparent fact that the human body has
reached its utmost limits of development, as a physical
organism, there seems to be a thinkable probability that
it will eventually, by a devolutionary process and by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
atrophy of its present clumsy and imperfect organs, return,
step by step, during the gradual cooling of this planet, to
the condition of the psychic life of a simple cellule, and
ultimately to the unconditioned; back, as Huxley puts it,
to the indefinable latency from which we arose; or, as
Carlyle expresses it, "pass stormfully across the astonished
earth from God and to God."</p>

<p>Starting from the simple cellule, we see, in a way, how
"Tanha," or the desire to extend the scope of activities, has
persistently striven in this direction until the ultimate possibilities
of the development of physical organism have been
reached in man.</p>

<p>This highly-differentiated organism has become more and
more sensitive to pain, more and more dissatisfied with its
limitations; and man, recognizing these limitations, desires
to abandon them altogether. Consequently, he seeks refuge
in the hope of a future life, where limitations will no longer
curb and embarrass him, and where he will cease to be
subject to pain, passion, and sorrow.</p>

<p>Jesus and Gotama have indicated how by the suppression
of this "Tanha," how by detachment from the things of the
world, we can approach that simple cellular life-stage which
is on the road to Heaven, Nirvana, and the Unconditioned.
It is easy to realize how much pleasanter it would have been
for us all if the simple cellule from which we spring had not
been so persistently ambitious in the direction of activities.
Its relatively prescribed functions suggest a most desirable
condition of peace compared to that "unrest which men
miscall delight."</p>

<p>Human life is but a drop in the ocean of organic existences
on this planet&mdash;about 1,500 millions only among
countless myriads of beings. It cannot, then, be accounted
strange in a world containing so great a variety of organisms,
with their varying tastes and needs, that man should find
much that is distasteful and unsuitable to him which is
pleasant and acceptable to other beings. The vulture feasts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
on carrion loathsome to man. Man partakes of food at
which a rhinoceros would shudder.</p>

<p>Morality, as a law and corollary of organized life, being
confined to humanity, it follows that immorality, as subversive
of this law, would be of necessity abhorrent to those
who appreciate a law without which social life would
become intolerable, and not worth living. But, when we
come to consider why it should be that the exquisite process
of the decomposition of flesh should be less pleasing to the
senses than the formation and fading of a sunset, we are
forced to the conclusion that the world was not made for
man, but man for the world.</p>

<p>The "part" working indiscriminately with and for the
"whole" is an ethical law observable throughout the
universe. All individuals are, unconsciously for the most
part, carrying into effect the will of God by the will of God.
We speak about individual effort to attain this perfection or
avoid that evil, because we cannot divest ourselves of the
feeling of free-will. To speak and act under a sense of
free-will is forced upon us by the delusion of separateness.</p>

<p>It is often the case that God is only recognized in the
beautiful aspects of nature. St. Paul says: "There are
diversities of operations, but it is the same God that worketh
<em>all</em> in <em>all</em>." We have to see God, not only in the sweet
waters, but also in the deadly swamp; in the healthy child
as well as in the f&#339;tid diseases of the sick. "That art
thou," as the Buddhist truly says. The delicious and the
disgusting are equally necessary as factors in the scheme of
the universe; there is in both the same cosmic law fulfilling
itself. "Dragons and all deeps: fire and hail fulfilling his
word." A difference only exists in the appreciation of
them.</p>

<p>This Monistic view of nature in no respect stands in the
way of our regarding God as the sublimated reality of an
ideal existence. Dr. Paul Carus, in his booklet on <cite>The Idea
of God</cite>, says: "If the idea of God is an empty dream<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
which we must expel from our minds, why not expel all
ideas and all ideals? They are just as much and just as
little real.... From this point of view a denial of the existence
of God would, with consistency, lead us also to a
denial of an integral, or a logarithm, or a differential. An
integral is just as little a concrete object as is God. And
the idea of God is just as important in the real life of
human activity, human thought and emotion, as the idea of
honesty is in the mercantile world, that of courage among
warriors, and that of faith in science."</p>

<p>Buddha has taught that there are worlds more perfect
and developed, and others less so, than this earth; and that
the inhabitants of each world correspond in development
with itself.<a name="FNanchor_Z_26" id="FNanchor_Z_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_Z_26" class="fnanchor">[Z]</a> Mr. Lafcadio Hearn says: "The Buddhist
denial of the reality of the apparitional world is not a denial
of the reality of phenomena as phenomena, nor a denial of
the forces producing phenomena objectively and subjectively....
The true declaration is, that what we perceive is
never reality in itself, and that even the ego that perceives
is an unstable plexus of feelings which are themselves
unstable, and in the nature of illusions. This position is
scientifically strong, perhaps impregnable."</p>

<p>Indian philosophers have attempted, with a fair measure
of success, to overcome the perplexity presented by the idea
of diversity in unity. They say that, "as an individual can
conjure up visions of various phenomena in his waking state
without destroying his sense of unity as an individual, so
there may be a multiform creation in the One Absolute
without any suppression of its unitary nature. To the
Unconscious Absolute phenomena stand in the relation of
dreams to the individual who is conscious of dreams on
awaking. But the Unconscious Absolute does not awake;
therefore 'It' remains unconscious of phenomena. The
variety of the world is like the variety of a dream."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span></p>

<p>In a commentary on the Essence of the Upanishads the
fictitiousness of emanations from unity is thus illustrated:&mdash;</p>

<p>"A belated wayfarer mistakes a piece of rope lying on the
road for a snake; the delusion disappears, but the rope
remains the rope. So with the apparitional world: the
delusion passes, and unity remains.<a name="FNanchor_AA_27" id="FNanchor_AA_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_AA_27" class="fnanchor">[AA]</a></p>

<p>"All the figments of the world-fiction may be made to
disappear in such a way that pure thought, or the self, shall
alone remain, in the same manner as the fictitious serpent
seen in a piece of rope may be made to disappear, and the
rope that underlies it may be made to remain. The rope
was only the rope all the time it falsely seemed to be a
snake. The fictitious world may be made to disappear as
the fictitious snake is made to disappear, and this is its
sublation."<a name="FNanchor_AB_28" id="FNanchor_AB_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_AB_28" class="fnanchor">[AB]</a></p>

<p>Professor Seth, referring in his book, entitled <cite>The Position
of Man in the Kosmos</cite>, to Mr. Bradley's <cite>Appearance and
Reality</cite>, remarks: "Reality 'must own' and somehow
include appearance." In another part of his book he writes:
"We are ourselves immersed in the process of the universe.
We can only live our own life, and see through our own
eyes. If we could do more, that would mean that we ourselves
had vanished from the universe; the place which had
known us would know us no more; and there would be, as
it were, a gap created in the tissue of the world."</p>

<p>Under "Mysticism," in the <cite>Encyclopædia Britannica</cite>, we
read: "Our consciousness of self is the condition under
which we possess a world to know and to enjoy; but it likewise
isolates us from all the world beside. Reason is the
revealer of nature and God; but, by its acts, reason seems
the thing reasoned about. Hence mysticism demands a
faculty above reason, by which the subject shall be placed
in immediate and complete union with the object of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
desire&mdash;a union in which the consciousness of self has disappeared,
and in which, therefore, subject and object are
one."</p>

<p>The Great Self, or Immanent Power&mdash;expressions barely
communicable to the understanding by the rather restrictive
sounding and abrupt terminology of the word "God"&mdash;perhaps
nearer in thought to the Will in Nature of Schopenhauer&mdash;with
which the Brahmins of India sought communion,
has been to them from time immemorial the
Alpha and Omega of their being. When religion steps in
it is a frame of mind, not a set of opinions. They cannot
in truth be called superstitious; they are, to coin a word,
<em>substitious</em>. They sink, plummet-wise, into the fathomless;
the line is severed, and they are lost in the depths and
caverns of nescience. The concrete, with them, has always
ranked lower than the abstract.</p>

<p>Vamadéo Shastri, writing in the <cite>Fortnightly Review</cite> of
November, 1898, on the theological situation in India,
says:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>In Europe, as I understand, your churches have long ago closed the
era of unlimited metaphysical speculation, retaining only certain mysterious
dogmata that are authoritatively prescribed as facts&mdash;that are
not philosophical discoveries, but are declarations of revealed truth.</p>

<p>You have drawn up your creeds; you have settled finally all essential
beliefs in future rewards and punishments, in man's redemption from
sin and resurrection, and, above all, in a Divine Personality. You have
numbered and ended the list of your sacred books; you look for no
fresh revelation; you have regulated by ordinances the rites and
ceremonies which unite the worshippers and divide the Churches....</p>

<p>But I want you to understand that we are still wandering in the
metaphysic wilderness, and that Christianity, returning at last after an
interval of so many centuries, finds us still engaged on the same
problems as those which occupied the schools of Antioch and Alexandria
and the secret professors of the Jewish Kabbala.</p>

<p>We have never yet set limits, either by philosophic criticism or by
ecclesiastic ordinance, to the range of free inquiry or to the thinking
faculty. We cannot submit to the restrictions placed by faith
upon inquiry into mysteries; we are driven by our mental constitution
to overleap the bounds of sentient experience, and to con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>struct,
like your ancient heretics, some intelligible theory of the unconditioned.</p>

<p>We are incapable of apprehending a Personality, except in the sense
of something that masks or represents an incomprehensible notion; and
dogmatic systems are to us no more than the formal envelopes of
spiritual truth.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Two cardinal ideas run through our deeper religious thought. One
is the Maya, or cosmic illusion, which cuts the knot of any difficulty
touching the relation between Spirit and Matter, and produces Unity
by exhibiting the visible universe as a shadow projected upon the
white radiance of eternity; the other is the notion of the soul's
deliverance by long travail from existence in any stage or shape.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In short, we have a religion, but no theology.</p></blockquote>

<p>"By Plotinus 'The One' is explicitly exalted above the
'&#957;&#959;&#8166;&#962;' and the 'ideas'; it transcends existence altogether,
and is not cognizable by reason. Remaining itself in repose,
it rays out, as it were, from its fulness an image of itself,
which is called '&#957;&#959;&#8166;&#962;,' and which constitutes the system of
ideas, or the intelligible world. The soul is in turn the
image or product of the '&#957;&#959;&#8166;&#962;' and the soul, by its motion,
begets corporeal matter. The soul thus faces two ways&mdash;towards
the '&#957;&#959;&#8166;&#962;,' from which it springs, and towards the
material life, which is its own product" (<cite>vide Encyclopædia
Britannica</cite>).</p>

<p>A consideration of the theosophy of the "Sohar," or
Book of Splendour, does not afford a key to the solution of
this problem. We meet there with the same difficulty, the
inconceivable transition point, where the "inactive" mingles
with the "active." Ensoph is the Absolute, the great
"I am," the endless, the boundless, the incomprehensible.</p>

<p>Mr. Bradley, in his book on <cite>Appearance and Reality</cite>,
asks whether we really have a positive idea of an absolute
defined as "one comprehensive sentience"; and he answers
that, while we cannot fully realize its existence, its main
features are drawn from our own experience, and we have
also a suggestion there of the unity of a whole embracing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
distinctions within itself. "Identity only exists through
differences, unity through multiplicity. Such is the constant
thesis of the Hegelian philosophy."<a name="FNanchor_AC_29" id="FNanchor_AC_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_AC_29" class="fnanchor">[AC]</a></p>

<p>The apparent connection between the Buddhist and
Christian conceptions of a God is very ably stated by Dr.
Paul Carus, and with the following extracts from his
writings I may fitly close the subject of this chapter:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Buddhism is commonly said to deny the existence of a
God. This is true, or not true, according to the definition
of God.</p>

<p>"While Buddhists do not believe that God is an individual
being like ourselves, they recognize that the Christian
God idea contains an important truth, which, however, is
differently expressed in Buddhism. Buddhism teaches that
Bôdhi, or Sambôdhi, or Amitabha&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, that which gives
enlightenment, or, in other words, those verities the recognition
of which is Nirvana (constituting Buddhahood)&mdash;is
omnipresent and eternal."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"Christianity possesses in the idea, and, indeed, in the
very word 'God,' representing the authority of moral
conduct in a most forcible manner, a symbol of invaluable
importance; it is an advantage which has contributed not a
little to make Christianity so powerful and popular, so
impressive and effective, as it has proved to be. In this
little word 'God' much has been condensed, and it contains
an unfathomable depth of religious comfort."</p>

<hr class="chap" /><div class="chapter" />

<h2><a name="Chapter_III" id="Chapter_III"><span class="smcap">Chapter III.</span></a></h2>

<p class="center">SOUL, SELF, INDIVIDUALITY, AND KARMA.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Verily every man is altogether vanity; for man walketh in a vain
show, he disquieteth himself in vain."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Bible.</span></p></blockquote>
<hr class="small" />

<p>The feat of mental gymnastics performed by Gotama
regarded as a phenomenal being, which led to the abrogation
of "soul" as an ego-entity from its dominion in the
minds of men, combined with the amazing fact that nearly
a third of the population of this planet has, for many
centuries, enthusiastically acquiesced in this dethronement
of animism, must be regarded as one of the most striking
wonders in the religious history of the human race.</p>

<p>As astronomical science disposed of the geocentric theory
of the universe, greatly to the advantage of theological progressiveness,
so the exponents of modern psychology hope
to dispel the delusion of the ego-centric theory of man, and
to clear the way for a more scientific and a truer conception
of that which is commonly understood by the word "soul."
According to the teaching of these psychologists, there is no
ego-entity, or hidden and mysterious factor, that stands
behind the psychic and physical organism of man.</p>

<p>The soul of man consists of a group of ideas, and these
ideas are in intimate connection with the so-called external
world, as also with what may be expressed as the internal
world of a Being wherein has taken place the development
of the hereditary germ.</p>

<p>In Buddhism it appears to me to be a matter of choice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
whether we apply the term "soul" to a group of ideas,
which, in the case of the Saint, as sublimated ideas, synchronously
cease with the formative faculty, and vanish
ultimately into the unconditioned, or to the effects of a
man's disposition, which continue as impressions on the
characters of those who receive them.</p>

<p>"Man" is a name for a materialized presentation of
reality&mdash;that is, for particles of matter assuming form under
the influence of a formative faculty and the results of the
interactions, relations, and qualities peculiar to the particles
and this particular aggregation.</p>

<p>On the occurrence of what is known as death the components
of the body are no longer held together, as it were,
by the formative faculty, and the body loses its vitality.
But, in the ordinary course of things, of form there remains
this formulative faculty, or impulse to re-combine. "Form
is destructible, yet it remains 'form' in the sense that it has
within it the power to renew form."</p>

<p>The most important factor in the formation of man is
not the material particles that make up his body, but
"form." This "form" is a reality, but not a materiality.
If the interaction of the component parts, under the influence
of externalities, ceases to work towards the preservation of
the formative faculty or re-combining influence, a material
presentation of "form" will not re-ensue, and the discontinuance
of the formative element is Reality, Truth, Nirvana,
God.</p>

<p>If the desire to describe a triangle on paper does not
exist, the materialized presentation of a real axiomatic
triangle will not be formed, while the perfect triangle still
remains a Reality. In this case, under certain influences,
the formative faculty has been subdued, and the consequence
is that the material form of the triangle, in its necessary
imperfection, has not been produced. The perfect triangle
is the undescribed triangle. Should bubbles on the surface
of the ocean be deprived of this formative faculty which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
made them as they are, the power to resume their shape
after dissolution would be gone for ever. But if the faculty
to re-form remained, they would again crop up on the
surface of the sea, the formative faculty making use of the
materials at hand under the influences of "form."</p>

<p>Analogously, the Saint, according to Buddhism, who is
rid of the formative faculty, does not re-exist as a phenomenal
being. It might be objected that to make use of the
expression "formative faculty" is only to revert to the
doctrine of essences and faculties as principles of explanation,
and to rely on the exploded superstition of <em>apriorism</em>.
But this is not the case. The formative faculty is a quality
of form, and form is an experience. The intangible and
manifest, such as form, can as reasonably be credited with
qualities as the tangible and material.</p>

<p>"The soul is a special form of life, as the flame is a
special form of motion." It is also a product of life, and
life is the arrangement and re-arrangement of matter, subject
to form, with which are associated the qualities of matter
and the relations and interactions of these qualities.</p>

<p>"Gotama," Dr. Paul Carus remarks, "strange to say,
anticipated the modern conception of the soul as it is now
taught by the most advanced scientists of Europe." St.
Paul, too, may be reckoned as one who, if he had lived in
these days, would have given his support to that positive
philosophy which regards the soul as a product of materiality;
for, he says: "Howbeit that was not first which was
spiritual, but that which was natural, and afterwards that
which is spiritual. The first man is of the earth earthy;
the second man (the soul) is the Lord from heaven."</p>

<p>When the distinction between the expressions "materiality"
and "reality" is clearly discerned, it removes a
difficulty out of our way when we come to consider a means
of bringing into harmony the Christian and Buddhist conception
of "soul." It has been contended that, if you deny
substance to the soul, it is tantamount to asserting the non<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>-existence
of the soul. But if it is admitted that "reality"
has existence as well as "materiality," this objection falls to
the ground.</p>

<p>The definition of matter as that which occupies space is
not a comprehensive one. It is only the definition of a
supposed quality of matter; it is abstracted in our minds
from other qualities. Therefore, if we regard "soul," more
especially in its sublimated condition, as something akin to
a quality of matter after matter, as we perceive it, has been
abstracted, we have a residuum which both Christians and
Buddhists alike can accept as an approximate explanation
of the nature of "soul."</p>

<p>The eschatology of the soul, as indicated in the two
systems, is less easy to harmonize. The soul, according to
Catholic notions, after the death of the body, undergoes a
purgatorial process; and, in the general view of Protestants,
awaits&mdash;sleeping or waking&mdash;in the ante-room of a judgment-hall
until a final verdict is pronounced on the Day of Doom;
and then, and not till then, is it allotted its ultimate rest or
unrest.</p>

<p>On the other hand, that which is in Buddhistic thought
the counterpart of this soul, whether we call it a "group of
ideas" or the "effects of Karma," must submit, till absolutely
bereft of the formative faculty or desire to live, to
continuous incarnations. This, however, does not involve
a process of transmigration, as is sometimes incorrectly
assumed.</p>

<p>Several illustrations have been made use of to explain
the migrationless nature of the process. "When a lamp
is lit at a burning lamp there is a kindling of the wick,
but no transmigration of the flame." A thought is conveyed
by words from one to another, but of the thought
itself there is no migration. Neither is there migration of
any part of an object to a photographic plate, nor in the
reflection of an object in a mirror.</p>

<p>It is matter for speculation whether the Christian idea of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
tarriance in an ante-room, and more especially the purgatorial
process, might not be strained in meaning so as to
imply that re-incarnation on this planet is the fate of some
souls, prior to their ultimate reception into Paradise or condemnation
to everlasting fire. Some such idea, maybe, was
afloat in the lifetime of Jesus, when the question was asked:
"Is this Elias come again?"</p>

<p>The Christian and Buddhist conception of "soul" differs
considerably as to position. The one stands isolated; the
other is not so posited. The soul, according to the
Buddhist, is not a "self-in-itself." "Buddhism does not
deny the existence of a soul or individuality, but denies the
independent existence of a soul or individuality." The
Christian conception of the soul corresponds with that
of Kapila, the founder of the Sankhya philosophy, in
so far as he conceived the soul to be a kind of transcendent,
sublimated body, the thinker of our thoughts
and the doer of our acts. This dualism was rejected by
Gotama.</p>

<p>It is necessary to bear in mind, with a view to the proper
comprehension of Buddhist teaching in regard to the
immortality of the soul, that, "although the Samskâras, or
soul-forms, constituting our existence, come to an end as
activities in the case of the saint who has extinguished desire,
there remains an immortal residuum in the unconditioned
elements of soul-form which are beyond the reach of death."
After death such a saint might be said to have a continued
existence (as others have) in the effects shed upon others by
his Karma during his lifetime. The difference, as I understand
it, is this: that, in the case of the saint, the <em>formative</em>
element of Karma, as it has taken shape in bodily existence,
ceases to be from the date of his sainthood; and subsequently
the effects of Karma, which <em>must</em> continue to be
shed on others as impressions as long as he lives, are informative&mdash;that
is, do not carry with them a desire to live;
and, consequently, the saint, from the date of his sainthood,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
may be said to have no continuing existence in the life of
another sentient being.</p>

<p>Dr. Paul Carus, in his handy little book, entitled <cite>The
Dharma; or, The Religion of Enlightenment</cite>, remarks:
"Buddhism sheds a new light upon Christian doctrine.
Thus the continuity in the evolution of life, which does
away with a wrong conception of a separate self, explains
and justifies the Christian idea of original sin (or, as it
ought to be called, 'inherited sin'); for men inherit not
only the curse of their ancestors' sin, but actually consist of
their sinful dispositions; every man is a re-incarnation of
previous deeds, and represents, for good and for evil, their
legitimate continuation."</p>

<p>"Being," in a Buddhistic sense, in the words of Professor
Oldenberg's translator, is the procession regulated by the
law of causality&mdash;of continuous being at every moment,
self-consuming and anew-begetting. What is termed a
"souled" being is one individual in the line of this procession,
one flame in a sea of flame.</p>

<p>So quaintly beautiful is the following dialogue between
King Milinda (the Greek King Menander) and the Saint
Nagasena that, notwithstanding its frequent quotation, I
venture to reproduce it:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The Saint Nagasena says: 'It is not the same being,
and yet they are separate beings, which relieve one another
in the series of existences.'</p>

<p>"'Give an illustration,' says King Milinda. 'If a man
were to light a light, O great king, would it not burn through
the night?'&mdash;'Yes, sire; it would burn through the night.'
'How, then, O great king, is the flame in the first watch of
the night identical with the flame in the midnight watch?'&mdash;'No,
sire.' 'And the flame in the midnight watch&mdash;is it
identical with the flame in the last watch of the night?'&mdash;'No,
sire.' 'But how then, O great king, was the light in
the first watch of the night another, in the midnight watch
another, and in the last watch of the night another?'&mdash;'No,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
sire; it has burned all night long, feeding on the same fuel.'
'So, also, O great king, the chain of elements of being
(Dhamma) completes itself; the one comes, the other goes.
Without beginning, without end, the circle completes itself;
therefore it is neither the same being nor another being
which presents itself last to the consciousness.'"<a name="FNanchor_AD_30" id="FNanchor_AD_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_AD_30" class="fnanchor">[AD]</a></p>

<p>The body disappears, even in Christian eschatology, as an
earthly body for ever; but its scattered chemicals are re-utilized,
according to some, to clothe the soul in heavenly
places, or for purposes of torture and indescribable anguish.
Others have sought consolation in the thought of the reappearance
of the body's elements in various beautiful forms&mdash;in
the ruby goblet, in the flowers, in the foam of the

<p>A writer in the <cite>Monist</cite> of January, 1898, makes the
following remarks in a reference to "self": "In the
psychological theories of Christianity and Buddhism there
is more agreement than at first sight appears, for it is difficult
to say what we must understand by self. 'Personality'
is used by Christian thinkers in a very loose sense. In the
doctrine of the Trinity it is not incompatible to speak of
three personalities in One."</p>

<p>He quotes texts from St. Paul's epistles to the Corin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>thians:
"I have planted, Apollos watered, but God gave
the increase. So, then, neither is he that planteth anything,
neither he that watereth, but God that giveth the
increase. Now, he that planteth and he that watereth are
one." In this connection the writer observes: "Here,
apparently, everyone is supposed to have no separate existence
whatever, except in God and through God."</p>

<p>The self, soul, or individuality, which continues after the
dissolution of the body, has been broadly described as
character or disposition; therefore, in using the term "self"
in a Buddhistic sense, we must put aside every idea beyond
what is conveyed to the mind by this interpretation. This
character or disposition does not come to an end as an
activity until "Tanha," or the thirst to live for living's sake,
is extinct. Therefore, when Buddhistic thought is converted
into conventional language, we must be cautious how we
interpret such a statement as "<em>We</em> are saved by our individual
merits." The "we" here means only "character,"
which, if improved during a lifetime, carries with it this
improvement, of which a new being will reap the benefits.</p>

<p>Professor Rhys Davids calls the mystery of Karma "a
desperate expedient, a wonderful hypothesis, an airy nothing,
an imaginary cause beyond the reach of reason." But he
previously states that it affords an explanation quite complete,
to those who can believe it, of the apparent anomalies
and wrongs in the distribution here of happiness and woe.
So it may be said, also, of the mysteries attaching to Christianity.
They satisfy the believer, though they present
difficulties to the reasoner. According to the Christian
formula, we are, as Burton says, fallen beings, not through
our own fault; condemned to death, not through our own
demerits; ransomed by a Divine Being, not through our
own merits.</p>

<p>The Buddhist saying, "From birth came death," and the
story of the Garden of Eden, seem to possess some figurative
connection with the transition of micro-organisms from a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
fissiparous to a duogynous condition. The am&#339;ba is endowed
with the potentialities of eternal life; but when the
spermatozoid and ovule (the symbolic serpent and apple)
appeared on the scene, when the luminous Adam passed
successively through the fissiparous and androgynous states,
and finally became man and woman, death entered into the
world.</p>

<p>The writer in the <cite>Monist</cite> already referred to, commenting
upon the text, "Every man shall receive his own reward
according to his own labour" (1 Cor. i. 5), says: "The
coincidence of Buddhism and Christianity is remarkable in
this passage; for, as the Buddhist Scriptures speak of the
fruits of Karma, so Paul speaks of the rewards of one's
labour."</p>

<p>Mr. Lillie, in referring to the doctrine of re-incarnation,
quotes from an article in the <cite>Church Quarterly Review</cite>,<a name="FNanchor_AE_31" id="FNanchor_AE_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_AE_31" class="fnanchor">[AE]</a> in
which, he says, "the author of the article, in proof of the
existence of this doctrine, adduces the question put by the
disciples of Christ in reference to the man born blind. And
if it was considered that a man could be born blind as a
punishment for sin, then it must have been plainly committed
before his birth." In the <cite>White Lotus of Dharma</cite> there is
an account of the healing of a blind man: "Because of the
sinful conduct of the man (in a former birth) this malady
has arisen." He also remarks that, in the case of the paralytic
(Luke v. 18), the cure was effected, not by any physical processes,
but by annulling the <em>sins</em> which were the cause of
the malady.</p>

<p>The Rev. Mr. Spence Hardy, in his <cite>Manual of Buddhism</cite>,
observes that "no one can tell but a Buddha how Karma
operates or how the chain of existence commenced. It is
as vain to ask in what part of the tree the fruit exists before
the blossom is put forth as to ask for the locality of Karma."
When the King of Ságal inquired where Karma resides,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
its locality, Nagasena replied: "Karma is like a shadow
that always accompanies the body. But it cannot be said
that it is here, or that it is there; in this place, or in that
place."</p>

<p>It has, I believe, been stated by some writers that it would
have been as well if Gotama had not encumbered his teaching
with such a complex and metaphysical theory as Karma, and
had confined himself to the admirable moral precepts which
form the real backbone of his system. It has been thought,
too, that in introducing Karma into his scheme of things
he was playing the <em>rôle</em> of an opportunist, because he felt it
to be necessary for the success of his mission that it should
not be altogether severed in outline from such a conception
as that of metempsychosis, which was deeply implanted in
the minds of the Brahmanic philosophers of those times.
Buddhism would certainly have been incomplete if it had
not included mysteries, as Christianity would not be Christianity
without an admixture of the indefinable.</p>

<p>"Karma," as "working," may, I think, be regarded as
one of the essential components of Christian thought with
regard to the soul. It is the working of the soul at the
same time, the being-made-soul or disposition. As the
latter it is heritable and appropriable; its effects are endless,
and this "working" is carried on, so to speak, from generation
to generation, organically and inorganically&mdash;in the
rock, in the flower, and in all animal life&mdash;the same producing
the same, and yet not the same.</p>

<p>The doctrine of Karma is justifiably proclaimed as the
most important tenet of Buddhism, for on it depends the
whole system of morality and of individual responsibility;
and yet, strange to say, there is no part of Buddhism which
has occasioned so much controversy and difference of
opinion. It is at once the foundation of belief for millions
of true believers and the basis of scepticism on the part of
many who would otherwise willingly concur in the dogmas
of this religion. In this respect it holds an analogous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
position to that of the doctrine of the resurrection of the
body in the judgment of Christianity.</p>

<p>Is it possible, some ask, that a belief in the doctrine of
Karma, which has exercised so enormous an influence for
good over countless millions of human creatures&mdash;many of
them men of the highest order of culture and intellectuality&mdash;should
only be resolvable into an "airy nothing"? We
may have to acknowledge that the reason is not able to
follow the idea of Karma through all its phases, nor yet to
assimilate the various postulates which it demands. But
can Christianity boast of doctrines which are always reducible
to the canons of reason and common sense? We think
not.</p>

<p>Here, again, we find a common ground between these
two religions. Neither is capable of being wholly defended
by matter-of-fact methods; both demand a certain measure
of faith from their adherents. The strength of the dogma
of Karma lies rather in the fact that, like the ideas of free-will,
heaven, and God, it is innate in a large portion of
mankind; and it would be sheer presumption to dismiss
with a few contemptuous phrases a belief which is deeply
embedded in nearly one-half of the human race.</p>

<p>The seeming injustice of the unequal distribution of happiness
and suffering among human beings is a problem
which Christianity does not attempt to solve. Buddhism,
on the other hand, grapples with the difficulty; and we have
the much-debated doctrine of Karma as the result. There
can be no doubt that this doctrine, once accepted, removes
all difficulty out of the way. Karma is literally "action,"
or "doing." This action, after death, and during life too,
bears fruit, for the consequences of action cannot be
destroyed. It is, in fact, the scientific theory of the conservation
of energy.</p>

<p>When the individual dies his Karma effects are re-incarnated,
as it were, in another being, and form the connecting
link between the two individuals&mdash;the one the author of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
Karma effects, the other the inheritor of them. In this
particular way we have a sufficient explanation and justification
of moral retribution.</p>

<p>How this second individual comes into existence expressly
for the purpose of inheriting the Karma of the first, and the
nature and mode of the transmigration of Karma, are
questions which have generally been placed beyond the
scope of the human intellect, and will be considered later
on.</p>

<p>A way out of this difficulty has been proposed, by which,
while still adhering to the essentials of the doctrine of
Karma, we can reduce it to a form more capable of being
grasped and supported by our reason; but it has no authority
among the utterances of Gotama, and, in accepting it, we
should be diverging somewhat from orthodox Buddhism.
Suppose we take as an analogy the case of a river, which,
after flowing some hundreds of miles, is dried up by the
heat of the sun. It is evident that the river, while flowing
between its banks, has been absorbed in a great measure by
the porous earth, and has gone to fructify the soil. The
trees, grass, and crops which have been produced by its
moisture are, of course, its Karma&mdash;the effects of its action,
or "doing." When it has ceased to flow, the whole of its
Karma has been dissipated into various effects, which, in
their turn becoming causes, exercise their influence over
practically the whole earth. There is no Karma, intact and
integrated, which, according to some views of Buddhism,
should be the <i lang="fr">raison d'être</i> of another <em>river</em>.</p>

<p>In the same way, an individual, while alive, scatters his
Karma (or the influence of his character) among his surroundings.
When he has ceased to live he has also ceased
to act, and, consequently, there can be no more Karma.
This is one way of getting rid of the idea of a lump of
Karma, which after death, in some way or another, is supposed
to produce, or to have produced, for it another body,
into which it may carry the defects, virtues, vices, and follies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
of its originator. Another weakness which has been considered
inseparable from the orthodox teaching of Buddhism
is the fact that it seems to fail to account fully for the action
of heredity. When two people have children, does it not
appear right to think that their children should inherit their
Karma? But it is obviously impossible that this should be
the case, except in the unlikely contingency of both parents
dying exactly at the moment of their children's birth. And,
again, why should a man's Karma be embodied in an individual
having no visible connection with his offspring; or
how can we reconcile the non-existence of self-hood as a
permanent entity with the recognition of a more or less self-sufficient
Karma, which preserves its separateness not only
through life, but after death, and into life again? These
and other similar questions arise, and demand explanation
from the bewildered brain.</p>

<p>These questions, it has been contended, do not arise as
difficulties impossible of solution, if we consider the analogy
given above. The children of two people are obviously
their Karma, and they appropriate, so to speak, a very large
proportion of the effects of their "doing"&mdash;as it is only
just and reasonable that they should do. Innumerable
actions on the part of the parents have led up to acquaintance
and union, and the birth of the child is merely the
climax of an endless chain of causes and effects.</p>

<p>But this process of reasoning closely borders on the
confines of metempsychosis, in the phraseology of which
the doctrine of Karma has often been mistakenly expounded.
The doctrine of Karma is a modification of metempsychosis,
and, as such, certainly stands on a more scientific and
rational basis than its prototype.</p>

<p>In consequence of the intermixture of the two theories in
the minds of exponents of Karma, much misapprehension
has arisen, and this doctrine continues to be a stumbling-block
to students of Buddhism. A considerable amount of
confusion arises also, I think, from the fact that writers on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
Buddhism fail to discriminate between Karma, the law of
Karma, and the effects of Karma, although the word Karma
includes the two latter. It is a mistake to assume that
Karma, interpreted as "thoughts, words, and actions,"
is perpetuated as such, for each thought, word, and
action passes for ever away while it happens; each
dies, yet each continues for all eternity in the effect it
produces.</p>

<p>"The being of a past moment of thought has lived, but
does not live, nor will it live."</p>

<p>"The being of a future moment of thought will live, but
has not lived, nor does it live."</p>

<p>"The being of the present moment of thought will live,
but has not lived, nor will it live."</p>

<p>It cannot be held, therefore, if we read Buddhism aright,
that Karma in itself possesses continuity.</p>

<p>"The 'I' of to-day has to take all the <em>consequences</em> of the
<em>actions</em> (Karma) which the 'I' of yesterday performed.
Thus the individualized Karma of future times will reap all
that which the individualizing Karma of the present time
<em>sows</em>."<a name="FNanchor_AF_32" id="FNanchor_AF_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_AF_32" class="fnanchor">[AF]</a></p>

<p>Professor Rhys Davids (<cite>Buddhism</cite>, p. 103) says: "Identity
is preserved in that which alone remains when a man dies;
in the result, namely, of his action, speech, and thought,
in his good or evil Karma (literally his 'doing') which does
not die." This statement would have gained in clearness
if he had written "<em>in the result</em> of his good or evil Karma
which does not die," in the concluding sentence.</p>

<p>If we allow ourselves to consider Karma, taken in the
sense of "doing," as retaining a separateness apart from its
diffusion of influences, and being carried on from generation
to generation as an individualized compound, then we at
once find ourselves in direct conflict with the doctrine of
"inseparateness," which is the mainstay of the rationality
of Buddhist thought, the basic concept of Buddhism.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span></p>

<p>If we understand by the Samskâras that phase of a man's
soul which is impressed upon other generations by heredity
and education, and that which "is preserved by the law of
Karma and conditions the continuity of man's existence in
the whirl of constant changes," it must be exclusively in the
sense that these Samskâras are formative faculties peculiar
to, and always to be found (in normal cases) in interconnection
with, those temporary aggregations which present themselves
to our perceptions as human beings, but which are
not permanent.</p>

<p>It is only when the expressions "Karma" and "action"
are used in their widest meaning, and include this formative
faculty, that they can with propriety be regarded as possessing
continuity, but not permanency. The particular formative
faculty ceases to be, in those exceptional cases when "it
directs itself to the cessation of all conformations."</p>

<p>This self-forming formative faculty, in its normal condition,
is the cause of the continuity of being, or becoming.
Its disappearance is happiness. We find this Buddhistic
truth very clearly stated in the New Testament. "He who
loses his life shall find it"&mdash;which, being interpreted, is "He
who loses the formative faculty shall find the deathless."</p>

<p>Karma, as "thought, speech, and action," must be
regarded as the ethical individuality, and the body as the
corporeal individuality. As things in themselves they are
both impermanent, but the effects of both are lasting.
There are physiological and local as well as psychological
results to be taken into account.</p>

<p>The body is continually shedding effects, and lives again
after death in its diffused elements; so Karma gives off
effects and lives again in its moral results; yet both these
individualities are inseparably connected as long as the
individual's life lasts.</p>

<p>The text so often quoted in this connection should, for
purposes of Buddhistic exposition, read: "What a man
sows, that will <em>the race</em> (not he) reap." "Herein is that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
saying true, one soweth and another reapeth" (John iv. 37).</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse"><span class="i0">"Man weaves and is clothed with derision;<br /></span></div>
<div class="verse"><span class="i2">Sows, but shall not reap.<br /></span></div>
<div class="verse"><span class="i0">His life is a watch and a vision,<br /></span></div>
<div class="verse"><span class="i2">Between a sleep and a sleep."<br /></span></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>What has been called physical or local Karma is applied
to the effects of locality and climate upon the development
of races and individuals.</p>

<p>A writer in the Journal of the Maha-Bodhi Society
(November, 1898)<a name="FNanchor_AG_33" id="FNanchor_AG_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_AG_33" class="fnanchor">[AG]</a> says: "The theory of Karma, as
Gautama formulated it, is all-embracing and comprehensive.
It ranges over the whole field of life and morality. It
ascribes causes for things; explains the working of the
complicated machinery of the cosmos; abolishes the unwholesome
idea of universal chaos and absence of motive
power; substitutes in its place a definite and well-arranged
system admirably suited to the needs of mankind; and
finally establishes firmly the supreme importance of individual
morality and responsibility. What more can one
desire? 'All very well,' the sceptic replies. 'It may perform
all you say it does, but I must be able to grasp it
thoroughly and work it out in my own mind. I will take
nothing for granted. I must be able to follow, to understand
it, and harmonize it with facts of which I have certain
knowledge. None of your vague insinuations for me.' I
reply: How can you with your limited and finite empirical
knowledge fully understand that which is limitless and
infinite? The doctrine of Karma embraces all the greatest
problems of life and the cosmos; and how can you, a mere
atom in the universe, expect to grasp the whole? It is
sufficient that you should have a working theory which
fulfils your requirements, and is at the same time sanctioned
by your reasoning power. More you cannot expect to have.
The doctrine of Karma, in short, marches step by step with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
our reason. At no point does it break away from the laws
of common sense. The difficulty lies in the fact that, while
our reasoning at a certain point comes to a halt through
lack of further material, the doctrine of Karma perseveres
onwards into the spheres of higher knowledge whither our
limited brain capacity cannot follow.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"There are two methods by which the doctrine of Karma
may be explained&mdash;viz., by individualization and by generalization;
the former is the more orthodox and popular, the
latter more sound and philosophical. But, although we
find in the recorded sayings of Gautama support of the
former and little or none of the latter, I think we may infer
that his attitude was due to the exigencies of the conditions
under which he lived and the ignorance of the masses who
surrounded him. For the same reason Christ was forced to
clothe his teachings in simple and primitive guise in order
that they might be readily grasped by the popular mind.
As an outcome of this necessity, we have the parables of
the New Testament and much of the veiled language therein
contained. To these are due in large measure the controversies
and differences of opinion which now exist as to
the proper interpretation of the words of Christ. The significance
of many of Buddha's utterances has been similarly
degraded. Countless 'birth stories' have sprung up to
satisfy the popular craving for something concrete and
simple in which to believe. Their themes have no real
authority in Buddhistic teaching, but they serve the same
purpose as do the Christian parables and myths. The
student of Buddhism who stumbles upon them by chance
may be led into false notions with regard to the religion,
and accept as authoritative that which has no real authority.
Herein lies their harm. That they are not strictly in
accordance with Gautama's teachings there can be no
doubt. The theory of soul-transmigration upon which these
tales are chiefly founded is an excrescence on Buddhism,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
and should be regarded in the light of a heresy. As
Professor Rhys Davids observes: 'Buddhism does not teach
the transmigration of souls. Its doctrine would be better
summarized as the transmigration of character.' Professor
Oldenberg puts with much clearness the teaching of the
action of transmigration and Karma when he says:
'Buddhism teaches: "My action is my possession, my
action is my inheritance, my action is the womb which
bears me, my action is the race to which I am akin." What
appears to man to be his body is in truth the action of
his past state, which, assuming a form realized through
his endeavours, has become endowed with a tangible
existence.'</p>

<p>"The same idea is expressed in a slightly different form by
Dr. Paul Carus, who says: 'We ourselves continue in the
accumulated results of our actions.' In these concise and
seemingly simple statements we have the fundamental
dogma of Buddhism and the foundation of Gautama's
system <em>as it has been handed down to us</em>. When we come
to analyze them carefully, the difficulties which at first lie
hidden become apparent. We see that a man during his
lifetime scatters the effects of his actions (<i>i.e.</i>, his Karma)
in all directions. Upon his death a new sentient being,
'realized through his endeavour,' comes into existence to
inherit and carry on his Karma. These two beings are not
connected in any way the one with the other. There has
been no transmigration of soul or of the ego, for Buddhism
denies the existence of either as a permanent entity, but
describes them as temporary aggregations only. How, then,
does moral retribution act? or how can we reconcile the
non-existence of self as a permanent entity with the recognition
of the existence of a more or less integral and permanent
Karma which preserves its separateness, not only
through life, but after death and into life again. How, too,
is it possible that his Karma, although scattered in all
directions during his term of life, at the moment of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
death is intact and whole for transmission to another
body?</p>

<p>"Moreover, it is obvious that, if the death of one human
being is the cause of the birth of another, the human race
would not progress numerically. The very fact of the
numerical increase of mankind defeats this theory and
renders it untenable by all those who desire to believe only
what their reason sanctions, and to eschew whatever demands
the acceptance of authority or the exercise of faith. In
short, as Professor Rhys Davids has put it, the weakness of
the Buddhistic conception is that 'the result of what a man
is, or does, is held not to be dissipated ... but to be concentrated
together in the formation of one new sentient
being.'</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"By digressing somewhat from strict Buddhistic teaching,
and leaving behind the <em>letter</em> (not the spirit) of the law, we
can, I think, arrive at a more satisfactory explanation by a
method I have called 'generalization,' in contradistinction
to the method just dealt with&mdash;viz., Individualization.</p>

<p>"According to the orthodox conception, an individual
takes up the Karma of another while it is intact and has
not suffered from distribution and dispersion. But there is
a broader and less primitive, albeit more heterodox, manner
in which we may regard the doctrine, and one which, I
think, we may infer was in the mind of Gotama himself
when he enunciated the narrower conception in order to
simplify it sufficiently to be capable of being grasped by the
ignorant. Instead of a man's Karma being individualized&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>,
handed on in an integral state from individual to individual&mdash;we
should regard it rather as having been generalized
and disintegrated during life, leaving no residuum at death.
Thus, what is inherited at birth is not the Karma of any
one person, but rather the Karma of the race as a whole.
'The souls of men continue to exist as they are impressed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
upon other generations by heredity and education,'<a name="FNanchor_AH_34" id="FNanchor_AH_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_AH_34" class="fnanchor">[AH]</a> but
the soul of the individual does not continue to exist. It
is the soul of the race, not of the individual, which is perpetuated.</p>

<p>"The Karmas of all are, as it were, cast into the mixing-pot
and thoroughly sifted, and then, and not till then,
embodied in different forms. Seeming inequality of division
must be accounted for by the action of local Karma.<a name="FNanchor_AI_35" id="FNanchor_AI_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_AI_35" class="fnanchor">[AI]</a>
There is obviously an advantage associated with this theory
not applicable to the theory of individualization. Whereas
the latter tends to promote the fallacious idea of personality
and self-hood, the former has a wider significance, and
tends rather to promote the belief in universal brotherhood
by merging personalities into one great whole. It is, in
fact, more truly Buddhistic, and, by inspiring a more cosmopolitan
sentiment of fellowship, is calculated to overcome, in
a great degree, that fallacy most difficult of all fallacies to
overcome&mdash;the idea of the ego as a permanent entity. The
difficulty, also, which is universally felt of accounting for the
birth of a new sentient being at every death is by this means
obviated....</p>

<p>"Most assuredly we require an explanation of our present
condition, and we must accord all honour to Buddhism for
having afforded us one both rational and satisfactory. When
men come to see and to realize that by every deed committed,
and by every word uttered, they are carving out, for
evil or good, the future of the race, and that the suffering
they now endure they owe entirely to the past sins of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
humanity, their sense of responsibility will be increased,
their hold upon morality strengthened, the bond of unity,
'the brotherhood of man,' confirmed. Abolish the fallacy
of cosmic chaos; substitute in its stead the idea of a
definite system and purpose; show that man is the only
framer of his destiny, the only author of his existence, the
only cause of his own suffering&mdash;and the foundation of
morality will be made sure, the redemption of the race
brought within measurable distance. This is the end for
which the doctrine of Karma was formulated, and to this
end it has been labouring, a silent but progressive force, for
many centuries."</p>

<p>The Rev. T. Sterling Berry, D.D., in his <cite>Comparative
Study of Christianity and Buddhism</cite>, treats the latter as a
whole in a spirit of commendable catholicity; but when he
comes to points of contrast he fails signally to preserve
equanimity of judgment, and distorts the import of Gotama's
precepts in the most amazing fashion in his endeavour to
bring them into opposition to the teaching of Jesus. His
view of Karma, however, is, I think, a valuable contribution
to the literature on the subject, and worthy of reproduction.
He writes: "Strange and well nigh unintelligible as this
theory seems, it is nevertheless possible, I believe, to get at
the real thought that moulded Gotama's conception&mdash;actions
of every kind as possessing the nature of seed sown; men
were found, to some extent, to reap the consequences of
their actions during their lifetime; but this takes place only
in a limited and incomplete sense during the existence to
which the actions belong. At the close of a life many
acts remain like seed sown, but not yet grown up. Hence
the theory that when a man dies he leaves the sum-total of
the acts of his life as a kind of complex seed, made up of
good and bad elements, which, by his death, springs up
into a fresh existence, the same and yet not the same; in
somewhat of the sense in which it might be said that
ordinary seed which springs up as identical and yet not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
identical with that which is sown. Viewed in this light, the
theory loses its apparent absurdity. It becomes, in fact, a
mode of expressing partly what we understand by the law
of heredity, which involves a transference of character and
a reproduction of the consequences of action; and partly
the law of retribution, that 'Whatsoever a man soweth that
shall he also reap.'"</p>

<p>The continuance of an individual's Karma, conceived as
the effects of a man's character upon individuals whom he
influences, is a perfectly thinkable process, and a generally
accepted fact. But, when we are called upon to consider
how it comes about that, on the death of a sentient being,
a new sentient being is at once produced, to take up the
effects of the deceased one's Karma, then we seem to be
launched into a mystery that can only be explained by
another mystery.</p>

<p>If such a doctrine is to be interpreted literally, it would
seem to necessitate a numerical equality of births and
deaths; a new-born babe would have to be ready at each
death to receive the Karma-effects of the deceased. It
might, however, be made faintly thinkable by including
available births in other solar systems, and by allowing for
a certain number of Karmas coming to an end by the attainment
of Nirvana. This planet is held by Buddhists to be
in sympathetic relationship with the other worlds, and there
are countless millions of beings who change places. A
number of men die somewhere on this earth, and they
may not be re-born here at all; a number of beings die
in some other planet, and may be re-born here at the same
time.</p>

<p>This particular phase of the doctrine of Karma has been
so distinctly enunciated in Buddhist writings that it becomes
a question for the interpreter of Buddhism to decide whether
it should be retained as a literal statement, and so dismissed
as an unthinkable, or whether it should be given the chance
of being classified as rational by expansive treatment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span></p>

<p>Buddhism is so systematically and eminently rationalistic
throughout its teaching that one feels impelled to a supreme
effort to sustain its reputation in this one respect. In any
case it would seem just to assume that it had a rationalistic
basis in the mind of Gotama, however difficult it may be
for us to discover the foundation of Rationalism on which it
rests. An apparently irrational theory should not be rejected
as irrational as long as it is within the bounds of possibility
that the apparent irrationality is due to the limitations of
our reason, or the absence of data, that have not come
under our experience and knowledge of Cosmic laws.
Everything may be contrary to what we think it to be; and
everything may be opinion only.</p>

<p>As some beautiful poems cannot be thought out in connection
with one's immediate environment without a loss of
poetic value, but require mental transposition to a distant
and different scene for their beauty to be fully and poetically
realized, so, unless we remove our imagination from its
every-day associations to an entirely different "scenery" of
thought, we cannot expect to intelligently appreciate the
complete significance of Buddhistic conceptions. As Professor
Oldenberg puts it, we must, when approaching the
study of Buddhism, divest ourselves wholly of all customary
modes of thinking.</p>

<p>Buddhism lays stress everywhere upon the connectiveness
of everything with everything; and everything is, at all
times, something other than itself. Consciousness (Vinnâna),
for instance, is described as "that which enters into the
womb, and from which arise name and corporeal form";
yet consciousness and name and corporeal form have no
individual existence.</p>

<p>"Body, perceptions, and sensations vanish, but not conscience;
but consciousness only exists as long as it is
connected with name and corporeal form. Consciousness,
however, is not essentially different from perceptions
and sensations; it is also a Samskâra, and, like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
all other Samskâras, it is changeable, and without substance."<a name="FNanchor_AJ_36" id="FNanchor_AJ_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_AJ_36" class="fnanchor">[AJ]</a></p>

<p>Consciousness has been described as the director of the
organs, and, in this sense, vaguely assumes the place of an
ego. Consciousness, as a "highly-developed and insubstantial
product of the brain," possesses the faculty of
acting <em>in the manner</em> of choice; it is derived from conformations,
and conformations from ignorance.</p>

<p>There is a continuance of soul-forms after the death of
an individual&mdash;that is, of the impressions caused by the
character of an individual. This is the preservation of
form by means of Karma (deeds). Obviously these soul-forms
cannot continue unless there is an individual to
receive the impression. Therefore, when it is said that,
immediately upon the death of a sentient being, another
sentient being is produced to receive the effects of the
deceased's Karma, the statement may have been only
intended to imply that for the continuance of soul-forms
there must always be sentient beings to receive their impressions.</p>

<p>It does not seem necessary to suppose that on A's death
B takes up the whole of A's Karma. The effects of A's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
Karma have been impressed, more or less, on all those who
have come in his lifetime, and will come after his death,
within range of his influence. In the latter case the influence
is continued in the effects of his writings, speech, or other
actions.</p>

<p>An individual during his lifetime will be impressed with
the effects of the Karma of many individuals, and has to
take the consequences, whether good or bad, with power of
adding to or modifying the received effects. "The same
character of deeds reappears wherever his deeds have impressed
themselves on other minds."</p>

<p>The subject of Karma becomes hopelessly complicated if
such a statement as the following is taken literally: "Buddhism
is convinced that, if a man reaps sorrow, disappointment,
pain, <em>he himself</em>, and no other, must at some time
have sown folly, error, sin; if not in this life, then in some
former birth." The language here employed is liable, unless
the reader is on his guard, to take him back to the heresy
of Metempsychosis, which Buddhism arose to destroy.</p>

<p>It perhaps needs reiteration that the "He Himself" in a
former birth is not even the deeds of a different set of
Skandhas&mdash;of a body of different constituent parts. The
"He Himself" is only the effects of deeds done by a constantly
becoming and constantly vanishing set of Skandhas,
the particles of the human tornado which assume temporary
form. The effects received become the "He Himself";
herein is the retributive phase of the doctrine of Karma.</p>

<p>The effects of Karma on their passage through preceding
births on to future births are the only existent and continuing
"I." A, who has received good influences from B, bad
from C, and indifferent from D, has lived before, in a
Buddhistic sense, in B, C, and D.</p>

<p>Buddhistic birth stories should, I think, be read in this
light. When A performs an action similar to one performed
centuries ago by B, it is to be understood that the effects of
that particular action in B have reached A through many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
intervening lives in either a modified or unmodified form.
Other actions of A which had not been performed by B
must be traced back in their effects to C, D, E, etc. A has
only lived as B by virtue of the effects of particular and
similar acts reaching him through the law of cause and effect.</p>

<p>"Within the sphere of causality we can all exclaim with
Jesus: 'Before Abraham was I am.'"</p>

<p>There is yet another direction in which we may look for
a solution of the problem. Life or being is frequently
compared in Buddhistic expositions to a flame which is the
same, and yet not the same, from the time it is lighted to the
time of its extinction. Each moment of being passes away
as, simultaneously or concurrently, a moment of being commences;
and in this sense, on the death of a being, another
being is simultaneously produced, until being comes to an
end with death, as the flame expires at the moment of
extinction.</p>

<p>This view agrees with that part of Buddhistic philosophy
which asserts that nothing <em>survives</em> being except the effects
of being; "being," in this connection, being taken as the
entire life-history of an organism, whether animal or vegetable,
and as the existence of a flame from its inception to
its extinction.</p>

<p>The working of the law of Karma has been found so
intricate that many Buddhists have relegated it to the
category of Unthinkables. They regard it as such that it
can only be understood by those who have attained to the
"<i lang="la">intellectus mysticus</i>." The one thing considered requisite
for the comprehension of its complexities is to solve the
problem of the Four Noble Truths by following the Noble
Eight-fold Path. A study of Buddha's psychology, they
contend, is absolutely necessary to the disciple who wishes
to know the processes of the ever-changing consciousness.
The mind in itself is pure, but by coming into contact with
impurities such as anger, harbouring of anger, selfishness,
etc., it is soiled.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span></p>

<p>The practical psychology of Buddhism is based on ethics,
and the student has to cut off all the impurities from the
mind to enable him to properly comprehend the Nirvanic
condition. So long as one thinks of self, so long is he
re-born. Unless self is absolutely surrendered, unless
"Thou hast lost thyself to save thyself, as Galahad,"<a name="FNanchor_AK_37" id="FNanchor_AK_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_AK_37" class="fnanchor">[AK]</a>
Karma continues; and that means ignorance; and ignorance
can have no vision of the Holy Grail, fails to reach
Nirvana, unites not with God!</p>

<p>There is no cessation in the continuous flow of thought
between one life and another until Nirvana is reached.
The "being" born in another life is absolutely not the
same that died here, nor absolutely another; but is the
result of the one. "My substance was hid when I was
made in secret, and curiously wrought in the lowest parts of
the earth."</p>

<p>Innumerable figures of speech have been brought into
requisition to convey to the imagination the import of the
terms "Heaven" and "Nirvana." None of these, taken
either separately or collectively, can be held to include all
that is indicated by the above expressions. To speak of
reaching Heaven, or Nirvana, is somewhat misleading; no
measurement of space is applicable to them; no phenomenal
expression in itself will pass muster.</p>

<p>A later and more material aspect of heaven, known as the
Western Paradise, and only referred to, I think, in the
Mah&#257;yana, has been provided, it would seem, for the satisfaction
of those who require a temporary halting-place for
thought before moving on to more abstract conceptions.
This heaven is illustrated with all those inimitable colours
and touches which oriental inventiveness uses with such
alluring effect. It is naïvely located ten millions of miles to
the west.</p>

<p>There, in a light that never was on land or sea, where
lotus flowers of every imaginable hue vie with each other
to cluster at his holy feet, sits enthroned the Buddha of
Infinite Light, the Compassionate, the Perfect One.</p>

<p>The sweet radiance of his pitying smile pervades the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
heavens for thousands of leagues. The beautiful expressions
of his countenance cannot be numbered, for they are
as countless as the sands of Gunga's sacred stream; nor
can his compassion be measured&mdash;it is illimitable as a shoreless
ocean. The magical grace of his form is compared to
the "moon on high when she marches full-orbed" through
the unclouded expanse of the Empyrean. If ever so
"gentle a zephyr blows amid the trees," the atmosphere
vibrates with all delicate and enticing melodies. The voices
of the Devas are heard chanting his praises. An aerial
choir, the birds of Paradise, answer back with antiphons of
rapturous song as they soar above in the gilded air which
fills the pavilions of the Blest. Such, and much more, is
the "Pure Land," the land of Amita, the Buddha of Infinite
Light.</p>

<p>The introduction into the picture of pavements of gold,
crystal streams, precious stones, jewels, and many of the
paraphernalia which the pageantry of this nether world
demands for its embellishment brings to remembrance the
splendours enshrined in that final revelation of things to
be, which was delivered to man in the person of St. John
the Divine.</p>

<p>Nirvana has been called "The Imperishable," "The
Infinite," "The Eternal," "The Everlasting," "The Transcendent,"
"The Serene," "The Formless," "The Goal,"
"The Other Shore," "Rest," "The True," or "The Truth."
It has been compared to an "island which no flood can
overwhelm," to a "City of Peace," "The Jewelled Realm
of Happiness," "An Escape from the Evil One."<a name="FNanchor_AL_38" id="FNanchor_AL_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_AL_38" class="fnanchor">[AL]</a> For the
Christian Heaven, in like manner, a great variety of
metaphors abounds.</p>

<p>But the mere gazing at, and admiration of, these pretty
pictures will not conduce to a comprehension of them&mdash;will
not help us to discover what formulated in the mind of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
artist the design of the picture he painted. For this needful
purpose it may not prove unprofitable to have recourse, in
the first instance, to the metaphysics of the grand old
Oriental mystic, St. Paul. By his assistance we may find
that these conceptions, Heaven and Nirvana, on which so
much wealth of imagery has been lavished, and about which
controversy has well-nigh exhausted itself, will resolve themselves
into something less indefinite, and more thinkable,
of one nature and of one significance.</p>

<p>In his Epistle to the Corinthians he tells us "God hath
chosen the things that are not to bring to nought the things
that are." Now, the "things that are not" must assuredly
be taken to mean that which is, figuratively speaking,
beyond the threshold&mdash;something, in this respect, more
than the subliminal<a name="FNanchor_AM_39" id="FNanchor_AM_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_AM_39" class="fnanchor">[AM]</a> reveals; in fact, the ultra-liminal, and,
consequently, the immutable. They are the quality Truth,
residing in, but inseparable, as long as senses last, from, the
"things that are"&mdash;namely, in materiality as we perceive it;
materiality being here understood as "potential feeling,
from which develop ideas, or the soul of man."</p>

<p>Ultimately perfected ideas, or soul, become this quality,
Truth; they become that which is within and outside all
things&mdash;in short, what Jesus calls "the kingdom of God
within," as well as the Heaven around us.</p>

<p>The expression "bring to nought" has its equivalents
in the terms "annihilation" and "extinction," so often used
in connection with Nirvana, for the desperate purpose of
depreciating the Buddhist conception of Heaven. The
"things that are" are material objects as we perceive them,
which are mutable, and never the same one moment together&mdash;never
really are, but are for ever undergoing a process of
becoming ("God calleth those things which be not as though
they were," Rom. iv. 17). Material objects are mutable,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
and Heaven and Nirvana are immutability. Plotinus says:
"The return to God, or The One (or Truth), is the consummation
of all things, and the goal indicated by Christian
teaching." This oneness, however, does not imply extinction.
"He who has entered upon Nirvana is not annihilated; on
the contrary, he has attained the deathless."</p>

<p>The identical idea is prevalent both in New Testament
teaching and in Buddhistic doctrine, that the realization of
that state of blessedness which is called "Heaven" in the
one case, and "Nirvana" in the other, could be brought
about during the lifetime of the saint. "But I tell you of
a truth, there be some standing here which shall not taste
of death till they see the kingdom of God" (Luke ix. 27).</p>

<p>"The kingdom of heaven is within you" is also a sufficiently
explicit statement on the part of the Christian
Scripture to substantiate the possibility of such an experience.</p>

<p>In an article published in the <cite>Monist</cite> of January, 1898,
and bearing on this subject, there occurs the following
passage, accompanied with extracts from the works of
several Christian mystics:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The Buddhist idea, that salvation consists mainly in
dropping our own self, in becoming nothing, in self-annihilation
for the sake of becoming Buddha&mdash;viz., divinely
incarnate&mdash;can be found in many Christian writers. The
highest religious aspirations are not the result of an anxiety
for the salvation of one's own soul, but a yearning for a
union with God."</p>

<p>Scotus Erigena writes: "In God all things will be put to
rest and remain One, Indivisible, and Immutable."...</p>

<p>"God does not perceive what is Himself."</p>

<p>According to St. Augustine: "If the soul is to comprehend
God, it must forget itself, for if the soul sees
and comprehends itself it neither sees nor comprehends
God."</p>

<p>"If the soul loses itself through God and forsakes all
things, it finds itself again through God."...</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span></p>

<p>"Whenever the soul comes to uniting itself with God it
becomes annihilated." ...</p>

<p>"All perfection and all bliss consists in this, that man
enters into the ground that is groundless."...</p>

<p>"How shall I love God? Thou shalt love Him as He is&mdash;a
not God, a not spirit, a not person, a not image; but
rather as He is&mdash;a true, pure, clear One, separated from
all two-hood; and in this One we shall eternally disappear
<em>from nothing into nothing</em>."<a name="FNanchor_AN_40" id="FNanchor_AN_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_AN_40" class="fnanchor">[AN]</a>...</p>

<p>Erckhart says: "How shall that man be who shall behold
God? He shall be dead. Our Lord says: 'No man shall
see me and live.'"</p>

<p>According to Buddhistic teaching, "He who has conquered
ignorance and got rid of desire enjoys the supreme
reward already in this life. His outer man may still be
detained in the world of suffering, but he knows that it is
not he himself whom the coming of the Sankharas<a name="FNanchor_AO_41" id="FNanchor_AO_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_AO_41" class="fnanchor">[AO]</a> affects."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span></p>
<p>Enlightenment and Nirvana are synonymous. "Buddha
is said to have entered upon Nirvana when he died. Yet at
the same time we are told that Buddha had attained Nirvana
already during his life."<a name="FNanchor_AP_42" id="FNanchor_AP_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_AP_42" class="fnanchor">[AP]</a></p>

<p>"If thou knowest the destruction of the Sankharas, thou
knowest the Uncreated" (Dhammapada); or, as Professor
Oldenberg's translator renders it, "Let others pursue the
uncreated by their erroneous paths which will never carry
them beyond the realm of the created. As for thee, let the
attainment of the Uncreated consist in this, that thou reachest
the cessation of the created."</p>

<p>Gotama, in a conversation between himself and an unbeliever,
said: "Illustrious disciple, Nirvana may be compared
to the nothingness defined as the absence of something
different to itself. We may justly define Nirvana as
that sort of non-existence which consists in the absence of
something essentially different."<a name="FNanchor_AQ_43" id="FNanchor_AQ_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_AQ_43" class="fnanchor">[AQ]</a></p>

<p>There are to be found several passages in the New
Testament which seem to confirm the interpretation given
to St. Paul's saying about the "things that are not."
Heaven is spoken of as an inheritance that fadeth not away&mdash;that
is, the "things that are" fade away, but the things
that are not do not fade away. The things that are not
seen (that are not) are eternal, and the things that are seen
(that seemingly are) are temporal.</p>

<p>This it hath not entered the heart of man to fully understand.
We only see through a glass darkly; through the
web of illusion. "But if we hope for that which we see
not, then do we with patience wait for it."</p>

<p>Jesus answering his interrogators, exclaims: "What
<em>house</em> will ye build me, or what is the <em>place</em> of my rest?"
This was a rebuff to those who endeavoured to localize the
illocatable. "The Most High dwelleth not in temples made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
with hands." "My kingdom is not of this world." Jesus
spoke to the people in parable because it was not given to
them to understand the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven.</p>

<p>Gotama said: "Whatsoever has not been revealed by me
let that remain unrevealed, and what has been revealed let
it be revealed."</p>

<p>With reference to the saying of Jesus, "<i lang="la">Multa habeo
vobis dicere, sed nunc non potestis portare illa</i>," St. Augustine
remarks: "<i lang="la">Manifestum est non esse culpandum, aliquando
verum tacere.</i>"</p>

<p>Dr. Paul Carus, in a chapter headed "Hinâyâna, Mahâyâna,
Mahâsâtu" (p. 230, <cite>Buddhism and its Christian
Critics</cite>), deals in a most masterly and effective manner with
the value of the symbolic in contradistinction to the essential
phases of Buddhism and Christianity. In judging the
Mahâyâna system (of Buddhism) and its fantastical offshoots,
he says: "We must consider the mental state of
those nations for whom it was adapted, and it may be that
a purer religion would have failed utterly where cruder
allegories of what appears to us as childish superstitions
exercised a beneficent influence. The Mahâyâna has
changed the savage hordes of Central Asia, from whom
proceeded the most barbarous hordes, dreaded by all their
neighbours, into a most kind-hearted people, with a sacred
passion for universal benevolence and charity."</p>

<p>With reference to the Christian Church, he remarks:
"What does it matter that, during the development of the
Church, the letter of symbolically-expressed truth has
crystallized into fixed dogmas?... He who believes in a
myth that contains, in the garb of a parable, a religious
truth, and accordingly regulates his moral conduct, is better
off than he who is void of any faith. The truth hidden in
the myth teaches him and serves him as a guide; it comforts
him in affliction, strengthens him in temptation, and
shows him in an allegorical reflection the bliss that rests
upon righteousness."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span></p>

<p>The words "rest," "peace," and "sleep" are in the New
Testament more often associated with the conditions of a
future life than such expressions as "joy" or "happiness."
The word "joy" is only to be found once in direct connection
with the word "heaven" in the New Testament&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>,
when there was joy in heaven over the repentance of a
sinner.</p>

<p>The omission may have been intentional, so that the
world might understand that the joy of heaven would be
something absolutely different from what we conceive of
joy; that there will be a kind of joy, in which joy, as it is
known here, is absent.</p>

<p>"There remaineth, therefore, a rest for the people of
God."</p>

<p>"He that hath entered into his rest, he also has ceased
from his own works as God did from his."</p>

<p>"Let us labour therefore to enter that rest."</p>

<p>"Ye shall find rest unto your souls."</p>

<p>Such texts seem to draw heaven and Nirvana very close
together.</p>

<p>It is undoubtedly implied in some portions of the Christian
Scriptures that the souls of the departed are asleep, and
will not be disturbed till the coming of the Lord and the
final judgment.</p>

<p>"Does not the testimony of the Bible lead us to this
conclusion; from the cry of the tired spirit of Samuel,
awakened from its sleep by the Witch of Endor, 'Why hast
thou disquieted me to bring me up?' to the saying of the
spirit in the Revelation, 'Yea, they rest from their labours.'
In the case of Lazarus we have the words of Jesus to this
effect: 'Our friend Lazarus sleepeth; but I go that I may
awake him out of sleep'" (from <cite>Light</cite>).</p>

<p>Many are in love with the satisfying beauty of this sleep
which has lasted since death began to be, and desire that it
might never be disturbed. This is that yearning for the
rest of Nirvana, for the peace that passeth understanding.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
The true mission of religious symbolism, of music, of poetry,
and the plastic arts is, not to excite the physical emotions
of man, not to crystallize appearances, but to translate his
soul to this condition of delicious swooning, to turn his gaze
inwards to what Brahmanic philosophy calls the fontal
essence of things.</p>

<p>From a poetical point of view, it is perhaps melancholy
to reflect that the seers of India are being rudely awakened
from their reveries, to be at last, as seems probable, completely
absorbed into the relatively sordid environment of
Occidental progress&mdash;in fact, to dream no more. The West
has murdered dreams.</p>

<p>Apart from the physical influences of climate and country,
the strange yearning of the Indian for an ultimate heaven of
unconsciousness may be accounted for by tracing it to a
vague remembrance in the human organism of the happy
condition from which it primarily emerged, before even
animal existence had entered upon the fairly peaceful life-history
of an am&#339;ba.</p>

<p>The process of transition from the condition of "are"
to that of "are not," from the phenomenal to the noumenal,
has been conceived by Buddhists and Christians alike to be
gradual. As a parallel to the "house of many mansions," so
often taken to mean by Christians a progressive ascent
through a number of heavens to a heaven of heavens, I
give below, in abbreviated form, the "spheres of formlessness"
as described by Mr. Lafcadio Hearn, in his book
entitled <cite>Gleanings from Buddha Fields</cite>.</p>

<p>"These," he says, "are four. In the first state all sense
of individuality is lost, and there survives only the idea of
infinite space or emptiness. In the second state this idea
of space vanishes, and its place is filled by the idea of
infinite reason. But this idea of reason is anthropomorphic,
it is an illusion, and it fades out in the third state, which is
called the 'state-of-nothing-to-take-hold-of.' Here is only
the idea of infinite nothingness. But even this condition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
has been reached by the aid of the action of the personal
mind. This action ceases; then the fourth state is reached,
the state of 'neither-namelessness-nor-notnamelessness.'
Something of personal mentality continues to float vaguely
here&mdash;the very uttermost expiring vibration of Karma&mdash;the
last vanishing haze of being. It melts, and the immeasurable
revelation comes."</p>

<p>Professor Oldenberg says: "It is not enough to say that
the final goal to which the Buddhist strives to pass as an
escape from the sorrow of the world is Nirvana. It is also
necessary to any delineation of Buddhism to note, as a fact
assured beyond all doubt, that internal cheerfulness, infinitely
surpassing all mere resignation with which the Buddhist
pursues his end....</p>

<p>"Does the path, then, lead into a new existence? Does
it lead into the nothing? The Buddhist creed rests in
delicate equipoise between the two. The longing of the
heart that craves the eternal has not nothing, and yet the
thought has not a something, which it might firmly grasp.
Further off the idea of the endless, the eternal could not
withdraw itself from belief than it has done here, where,
like a gentle flutter on the point of merging in the nothing,
it threatens to evade the gaze."</p>

<p>Nirvana, according to Mr. James Freeman Clarke, means
to the Buddhist the absolute eternal world beyond time and
space; that which is <em>nothing</em> to us now, but will be <em>everything</em>
hereafter.</p>

<p>Students of Buddhism are often confronted with the
question why sorrow and pain should have held such
prominent places in the mind of Gotama. Explanations
have been afforded that this was due, in a large measure, to
a pathetic nature, born of climate and environment. The
<em>mind</em> of the inhabitants of Hindustan is still an unfathomable
mystery; the great heart of India beats slowly, and
those waves of sprightly emotion which are distinctive
peculiarities of the natives of Europe are but barely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
discernible ripples on the still surface of the Indian
character.</p>

<p>To the poetic people of the Ganges the immense plains
of India, their broad and voiceless rivers, the magic beauty
of an oasis, the distant silence of the Himalayas, the
brooding calm of the atmosphere, all appear to labour in
unison to the same end&mdash;to fashion the restless heart of
mortals after their own emotionless image, to expand it into
that fulness of peace which is theirs, and to guide the
children of men into the haven where they would be.</p>

<p>This mode of thought, or no thought; this complete
abandonment of self, culminating in the ascetic, to the
desire of union with the Infinite, can be differentiated from
the meditative pose of the Christian by the absence in it of
anything approaching to emotion or affection. These are
weaknesses to be set aside. There can be no calm where
sensations enter&mdash;not even a breath of divine love must stir
the ocean of their pictured rest. Gotama fully recognized
that true joy was only to be found when the notion of self-hood
was in abeyance, as it most certainly is found invariably
in those cases in which we lose, as it were, the sense of
objective being in an absorbing subject, or in the presence
of a fascinating personality.</p>

<p>There is an indescribable pleasure realizable in engrossing
occupations of mind and body which distract attention from
ourselves as selves. Hence the apotheosis of love as the
ultimate possible bliss, whether it be manifested in the adoration
of the human or in the ecstasy of the saint. Charles
Beaudelaire declares the whole aim of life is to dispel <i lang="fr">ennui</i>&mdash;the
<i lang="fr">ennui</i> of sitting still by walking, of lying down by
change to an erect posture, and so on. Virtue, vice, love,
etc., are all efforts to attain a state of oblivion of our individuality,
to <i lang="fr">s'enivrer</i> with distractions of some sort or
another. Sorrow is the realization of ourselves as separate
entities. The Buddhists declare that, when we rid ourselves
of the idea of this separateness, then, and then only,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
will true joy be found. The same truth is expressed in the
New Testament: "He that loseth his life shall gain it."</p>

<p>The drooping head upon the cross, the livid corpse of
the Saviour&mdash;such pictures are strikingly emblematic of the
sacrifice of self-hood, which is ever the cause of pain. Self-hood
crucified&mdash;that is the Great Deliverance, that is
Heaven, that is Nirvana! We must do more than take up
the cross and follow; we must hang upon it, be nailed to
it, if we would be saved.</p>

<p>It has been urged that the foundations of Buddhism rest
upon the assumption that life is not worth living; everything
leads to pain and sorrow; the joys of life are ignored.
Hence, if it were proved that the enjoyments of life out-weighed
the sorrows, would it not be clearly shown that
Buddhism is <i lang="fr">de trop</i>? For it is clear that life, in that case,
would be worth living. This view of life is not only supported
by a general consensus of opinion, but seems to be
additionally strengthened by the universal desire to live.
That this desire would not exist if the pessimistic idea of
Buddhism regarding existence were well founded is evident.</p>

<p>In opposition to this view, my conception of Buddhism,
as represented in its literature, is that its foundations rest
upon the assumption that there is a life more worth living,
in which all sorrow is eradicated; that only ignorance leads
to pain and sorrow; that knowledge leads to their extinction.
I am not aware that the joys of life are wholly ignored by
Buddhists.</p>

<p>If it is granted that happiness predominates over unhappiness,
and that life must consequently be worth living, this
need not exclude the desire for a life more worth living, in
which there is no unhappiness. If Buddhism is the wretched,
pessimistic system it is declared by some to be, why should
it not be allowed to hypothecate a heaven, when even the
joyous, optimistic Christian, who finds life so worth living,
speaks of being "delivered from the misery of this sinful
world," and hopes for a life worth living?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span></p>

<p>Quite three-quarters of the population of this planet, as
represented by its religious beliefs, which is supposed to find
life worth living, looks through the spectacles of faith towards
a life more worth living, after the dissolution of the body.
In short, there are two distinct lives recognized by Buddhists&mdash;the
<em>living</em> life and the <em>non-living</em> life; and it goes without
saying that the latter is by far the more desirable of the
two.</p>

<p>Dr. Paul Carus says: "The good tidings of Buddha's
religion are not so much the recognition of the existence of
pain and care as the conquest of evil and the escape from
suffering. The following verses from the Dhammapada
have no pessimistic ring:&mdash;</p>

<p>"'Let us live happily, then, not hating those who hate us!</p>

<p>"'Among men who hate us, let us dwell free from hatred!</p>

<p>"'Let us live happily, then, free from ailments among the ailing!</p>

<p>"'Among men who are ailing, let us dwell free from ailments!</p>

<p>"'Let us live happily, then, free from greed among the greedy!</p>

<p>"'Among men who are greedy, let us dwell free from greed!'"</p>

<p>There are many passages to be found in the New Testament,
in our Christian Liturgy, and especially in the
Hymnology of the Churches, which emphasize "suffering"
as the normal and inevitable condition of humanity, almost
leading one to suppose that it is the predominant factor in
human life.</p>

<p>In the Burial Service we thank God that our brother has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
been delivered from the miseries of a sinful world, and Job
is brought into requisition to show that "man that is born
of woman is <em>full</em> of sorrows."</p>

<p>In a beautiful hymn we have the following verse:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse"><span class="i0">"If I find Him, if I follow,<br /></span></div>
<div class="verse"><span class="i2">What His guerdon <em>here</em>?<br /></span></div>
<div class="verse"><span class="i0">Many a sorrow, many a labour,<br /></span></div>
<div class="verse"><span class="i12">Many a tear."<br /></span></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>For an assembly of young men and maidens in the first
rapturous dawn of maturing youth to sing&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse"><span class="i0">"O Paradise, O Paradise,<br /></span></div>
<div class="verse"><span class="i2">'Tis weary waiting here,"<br /></span></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>though delightfully pessimistic, does not seem quite up to
the standard of absolute truth.</p>

<p>These sorrows, these labours, these tears, this weary
waiting, represent the experiences in store for the initiate,
and the conditions under which the Christian must progress
who would reach the goal of his dearest aspirations.</p>

<p>"Death is self-surrender; all loss is a kind of death; the
only-begotten Son is the summing up of what is dearest,
most <em>one's own</em>&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, God can only be <em>at one</em> with his work,
can only make it to be truly his work by eternally dying&mdash;sacrificing
what is dearest to him. God does not, therefore,
<em>cease to be</em>; he does not annihilate himself; he lives eternally
in the very process of sacrificing his dearest work. Hence
God is said to be love; for love is the consciousness of survival
in the act of self-surrender.... Such would be the
<em>atone</em>ment of the world-god eternally living in his own death,
eternally losing, and eternally returning to, himself" (Nettleship).</p>

<p>It cannot be denied that "suffering" was the burden of
Gotama's song, the refrain of his passionless, yet beautiful,
utterances.</p>

<p>Jesus has been described "as a man of sorrows and
acquainted with grief."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span></p>

<p>Jesus wept.</p>

<p>The whole creation weeps.</p>

<p>"What think ye, my disciples (the Perfect One said),
whether is more, the water which is in the four great oceans,
or the tears which have flown from you, and have been shed
by you, while ye strayed and wandered in this long pilgrimage,
and sorrowed and wept because that was your portion
which ye abhorred, and that which ye loved was not your
portion? And while ye experienced this through long ages
more tears have flown from you, and have been shed by
you, while ye strayed and wandered on this long pilgrimage,
and sorrowed and wept because that was your portion which
ye abhorred, and that which ye loved was not your portion,
than all the water which is in the four great oceans"
(Oldenberg's <cite>Buddhism</cite>).</p>

<p>St. Paul conjures up a vision of the immense figure of
creation, prostrate, groaning beneath the silent heavens.
"The true Buddhist certainly sees in this world a state of
continuous sorrow; but this sorrow only awakes in him a
feeling of compassion for those who are yet in the world.
For himself he feels no sorrow or compassion.... He seeks
Nirvana with the same joyous sense of victory in prospect
with which the Christian looks forward to his goal, everlasting
life" (Oldenberg).</p>

<p>The doctrine of an irrevocable doom for the unbeliever
and obdurate sinner is not easy to follow, because it would
seem to imply "a failure of the redemptive work of the
Saviour unless all for whom he died ultimately partake of
salvation." If many are called and but few are chosen; if
the gate is narrow, and only a microscopic minority enter
thereby, the supreme sacrifice of the only-begotten Son of
God is liable to lose significance in the eyes of an <em>exigeant</em>
public.</p>

<p>Jesus "treated popular religious terms such as Hell and
Heaven as symbols." "He employed the familiar images
of Heaven and Hell to impress on men's consciousness the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
supreme bliss of righteousness and the awful misery of
sin."</p>

<p>"When our Lord came, he found the doctrines of last
things presented in forms already fixed, and the terms
Gehenna, Paradise, etc., in familiar, even proverbial, use"
(Eschatology, <cite>Encyclopædia Britannica</cite>).</p>

<p>Every being, according to Buddhistic teaching, attains
Nirvana in the end; so may it not be in "the times
of the restitution of <em>all things</em>, which God hath spoken
by the mouth of all his holy prophets since the world
began"?</p>

<p>If symbolism were only taken for what it represents, every
Buddhist could join with the Christian in many of the
exquisite invocations of the Psalms. There is no rest to
be found in the impermanent. To find the peace which
passeth understanding, we must ultimately have recourse to
the unconditioned, the permanent, Nirvana, God. The
prayer of the Christian as well as the aspiration of the pure
Buddhist is to be, whether living or dead, one with the
Uncreate.</p>

<p>Professor Oldenberg says that "the devotion of abstraction
is to Buddhism what prayer is to other religions."
There is here a distinction without a difference.
Abstraction is nothing more nor less than true,
perfect, sublimated prayer. Real, unadulterated prayer
is only possible when the mind is totally relieved of distractions.</p>

<p>Jesus went apart to pray; so the Buddhist monk seeks
the silence of the forest or the seclusion of the cave to
commune with the unconditioned, with "Our Father which
art in Heaven," with the Uncreate of the Athanasian Creed.
He who abstracts himself from the "plurality of the phenomenal
world" anticipates the cessation of the impermanent.</p>

<p>"Come, then! Into solitude will I go, into the forest
which Buddha praises; therein it is good for the solitary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
monk to dwell who seeks perfection. In the <em>sîta</em> forest rich
in blossoms, in the cool mountain cave, will I wash my body
and walk alone."</p>

<p>The counting of inhalations and exhalations of the breath,
and other practices of a like nature, are used as so many
short cuts to this state of abstraction or prayer. For this
purpose they are as valuable as ceremonial magic professes
to be for the ready acquisition of power over unknown laws
and qualities of nature.<a name="FNanchor_AR_44" id="FNanchor_AR_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_AR_44" class="fnanchor">[AR]</a></p>

<p>Christianity and Buddhism cannot be differentiated in
this matter of abstraction. Gibbon writes: "The fakirs of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
India and the monks of the Oriental Church were alike
persuaded that, in total abstraction of the faculties of the
mind and body, the purer spirit may ascend to the enjoyment
and vision of the Deity." The opinion and practice of
the monasteries of Mount Athos will be best represented in
the words of an Abbot who flourished in the eleventh
century. "When thou art alone in thy cell," says the
ascetic teacher, "shut thy door, and seat thyself in a
corner; raise thy mind above all things vain and transitory;
recline thy beard and chin on thy breast; turn thy eyes and
thy thoughts towards the middle of thy belly, the region of
the navel, and search the place of the heart, the seat of the
soul. At first all will be dark and comfortless; but, if you
persevere day and night, you will feel an ineffable joy; and
no sooner has the soul discovered the place of the heart
than it is involved in a mystic and ethereal light."</p>

<p>Here, in these practices attributed to Christian saints, we
have an exact parallel to those in use by Hindu ascetics
even of the present day. It must be clearly understood,
however, that the Buddhist attaches no merit to such practices,
unless they conduce to the banishment of ignorance.
Asceticism, as a thing in itself, is useless.</p>

<p>Heaven and Nirvana are unpainted pictures, undescribed
actualizations; they are realities, not materialities. There
is a never-ending, unsatisfied, restless craving, conscious or
unconscious, throughout the Kosmos to enter upon reality.
The suns and their satellites whirl about aimlessly in search
of it. The whole universe is in sore trouble because, through
ignorance, it is not. "The vulture's eye hath not seen it;
the lion's whelps have not trodden it, nor the fierce lion
passed by it. The depth saith, It is not in me; and the
sea saith, It is not with me." And yet it is there!</p>

<p>The use of such exaggerated terms as "immense,"
"infinite," "illimitable," etc., is to be accounted for by
referring the habit to unconscious efforts by the conditioned
to express the unconditioned. The sea, mountains, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
heavens, owe their fascination to a suggestion of the unconditioned
possessed by them.</p>

<p>In moments of attempted aspiration we are prone to look
upwards into space&mdash;a symbol of the boundless. On the
other hand, when the mind is engaged in working out
details and calculations, there is the habit of looking downwards.
Not only men, but beasts of the field, look upwards
for help in their dying moments; upwards into space,
where the conditioned seemingly vanishes into the unconditioned.</p>

<p>I have often witnessed the pleading expression of dying
antelopes and other wild animals, their eyes being almost
invariably directed to the sky above in their last moments
of life.</p>

<p>I was on one occasion more than usually struck with this
beautiful expression&mdash;appealing, as it were, to the skies for
mercy&mdash;in the case of a wounded bear when in its death
throes amid the snowy solitudes of the Himalayas.</p>

<p>Let us draw the curtains apart, and behold for a moment
the scene of the enacted tragedy. Out of the violet mists
spread by the viewless hands of a yet unrisen sun,
black crags uplifted their glacier breasts to receive the first
ravishing kiss of dawn; and the forests, obedient to the
silence imposed by the kingly peaks, stood austere and
unstirred by the affectionate airs of heaven. The staining
blood, the furry mass, the clutching claws of the wild
monster in his struggle with life and death, presented to the
imagination some weird sacrifice consummated upon an
altar, built of immaculate snow.</p>

<p>It was then that this remarkable pleading expression of
the eyes arrested the attention of my Himalayan huntsman,
who, turning round to me, exclaimed: "He is seeing God."
The Psalmist says: "I will lift up mine eyes to the hills,
from whence cometh my help."</p>

<p>Human beings, as well as all animal nature, seem to
make their final appeal for help or pity to something above<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
or beyond this conditioned world. The enhancement of
the beauties of landscape and architecture by the effects of
mist and twilight is due to the obliteration of detail by
these atmospheric conditions. Detail is fatiguing to the
eye and brain. These organs unconsciously demand the
repose which the absence of detail confers. Hence the
charm of impressionism in Art.</p>

<p>In the countenances of the blind, who possess one sensation
the less to distract and weary them, there is not
infrequently to be noticed a peculiar scintillation of peace
which seems to speak to one of the time when all sensations
will cease to be, and to herald the approach of that eternal
beatitude which is so highly uplifted above the joys of this
transitory world.</p>

<p>There is also a strong Nirvanic suggestion in the appearance
of some of the eminent ecclesiastics of the Roman
Catholic faith, in those instances where the flesh shows
traces of the consuming fire of asceticism. Benevolence,
compassion, love, genius, joy&mdash;all these are presented, but
with a minimum of the earthy adhering to them. In this
aspect they create an impression very different to that communicated
to us by the comfortable placidity of those who
have only experienced happiness of a less exalted description.<a name="FNanchor_AS_45" id="FNanchor_AS_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_AS_45" class="fnanchor">[AS]</a></p>

<p>In "stillness," another attribute of the unconditioned,
there abides an enchantment that cannot be surpassed by
other conditions. Yet even the rapture engendered by the
sight of a furious and incontinent sea can be explained by
the fact that the pleasure derived therefrom is solely due<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
and in proportion to the magnitude of the display, and
magnitude suggests the "illimitable."</p>

<p>The ambition to scale the highest summits, in whatever
position or capacity, the idea of resurrection, the fascination
of the word "eternal," the hope of everlasting rest&mdash;all these
tend in the same direction, all point to the Empyrean,
where detail seems to fade into a vacuum, into Nirvana,
into Heaven, into God.</p>

<h2><a name="Chapter_V" id="Chapter_V"><span class="smcap">Chapter V.</span></a></h2>

<p class="center">SOME CONCLUDING REMARKS.</p>

<hr class="small" />
<p>It is only when we come to take a bird's-eye view of these
two great religions, which have exercised so enormous and
so abiding an influence over the human race, and when
clearness of vision is unobscured by numberless petty
details and dogmas, that we can perceive the factors
common to both which have given them their present
stability and strength.</p>

<p>No religion, no system of morals, no philosophy, can
be secure unless they rest upon the groundwork of universal
truth and necessity; and it is certain that, if Christianity
and Buddhism did not possess these supports, they would
not now be what they actually are&mdash;the ruling forces to
millions of human beings.</p>

<p>It has been said with much truth that the daily life of an
ordinary man is a continual round of intoxication. Some
form or other of inebriating excitement seems absolutely
necessary to him, if he is to escape from the Slough of
Despond of <i lang="fr">ennui</i> and all its evil consequences. The
remark is equally true of the human race as a whole. It
cannot survive, apparently, without constant stimuli to urge
and goad it forward. Were such stimuli wanting from time
to time, man would probably degenerate, and cease to show
that love of progress and activity which is so essential to
his existence as man. Consequently, we note, looking
back through the vista of history which lies open to our
view, the periodical appearance of some great religious
reformer, whose task it is to infuse new zeal and strength
into the flagging energies of his fellow-creatures. Gotama,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
Jesus, Savonarola, General Booth, are all greater or lesser
instances in point; have all worked upon the same basic
conception, however different the condition of their times
may have required the superficial doctrines of their various
creeds to be.</p>

<p>Some&mdash;Jesus and Gotama, and possibly Mahomed&mdash;worked
with the full cognizance of the task before them;
others, who have not been gifted with so large a measure of
divine insight, have wrought and lived for the same purpose,
blindly, and unconscious of the complete significance of
their action.</p>

<p>But, it may be asked, if Jesus and Gotama were gnomic,
how comes it that the Buddhism and Christianity of to-day
are so radically different in their outward manifestations?
To answer this question we have merely to take a broad
glance at history.</p>

<p>At the time of the advent of Gotama the people of India
were in possession of a civilization remarkable in many
respects, but most remarkable, perhaps, in the freedom and
latitude of thought prevalent. It is difficult for many who
have been brought up within the contracted influences of
those who regard all alien religions and non-Christian
countries as so many black spots on the pages of history
and on the maps of the world, and who have been surrounded
in their youth by the innumerable restrictions
placed upon all speculative propensities, to realize that, at
the time when they were mere cave-dwellers and unclothed
sojourners with the beasts of the field, a great and lofty
civilization was existent in what they would possibly consider
a barbarous corner of the globe, and that a people there
held dominion whose chief intellectual pastime was to range
over the vast domains of speculative thought and all the
interminable mysteries of life. The Indian has been a
philosopher by birth and breeding from time immemorial;
and only among a race of philosophers could such a religion
as Buddhism, with its sudden iconoclasm, have been preached<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
with so little opposition, and have taken root so rapidly,
when we come to consider the strong hold the Brahmanical
ceremonial had upon the people at that time.</p>

<p>With the inception of Christianity, however, the case was
very different. At the birth of Jesus the inhabitants of
Palestine, with the exception of the Essenes, were sunk low
in the mire of bigotry, prejudice, and priestly domination.
The mind of the people was less philosophically prepared
to grasp a broad and exalted creed such as essential Christianity;
it required dogmas more definite, doctrines more
easily comprehended; and Jesus had perforce to mould his
utterances to the temperament and mental capacity of the
people among whom he preached.</p>

<p>To the east of the Holy Land was India, with its refined
and more perfect civilization; to the west, Central Europe,
with its savage and ignorant tribes, worshippers of trees, and
in servitude to many superstitious practices and customs.
Christianity, with its immense potential resources, its innate
power for good, required some outlet for its activities; and,
as was only natural, it spread in the direction where a pure
and sublime religion was most needed, and experienced
little difficulty in eventually conquering the savage intellect
of Central Europe. Becoming appropriated by men who,
living in the far North, depended for their very life upon a
ceaseless struggle with adverse circumstances, it gradually
lost the softening and refining influences which are so
characteristic of the Oriental temperament, and became the
vehicle for the passions and ambitions of a race more brutal
and more unsympathetic than that among which it took its
rise.</p>

<p>And to what an extent has this religion of Christ, the
evangel of peace and goodwill, been since prostituted!
The mistaken&mdash;though, no doubt, well-intended&mdash;dogmas
formulated by the Holy Catholic Church proved to be, in
their short-sightedness and complete lack of insight into
human nature, a prolific source of degeneration, bigotry,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
persecution, ignorance, immorality, and extreme ecclesiastical
tyranny in the Dark Ages. The rigid and narrow
doctrines inculcated by the Puritans have been almost as
fruitful a cause of moral perversion and reckless narrow-mindedness.
To-day it must be acknowledged that we have
outgrown the gross and debasing Christianity of those
mediæval times; but many of us are still fast chained in
the shackles of prejudice and intolerance, with all their concomitant
delusions and hypocrisies.</p>

<p>Bruno, in his day, said: "Christianity has been tried for
eighteen centuries; the religion of Christ remains to be
tried." This remark, however, overstates the case considerably,
for it must be confessed that there have been
many instances of individual lives which have approached
as closely to the ideal as far as it has been practicable within
human limits.</p>

<p>True Christianity many of us have yet to learn; it is but
the husk which exists with the many as yet. Nevertheless,
we flatter ourselves sometimes as the elect of the earth,
and despatch emissaries of civilization to the darkest
corners of heathendom to carry with them only a very
imperfect presentment of our great religion in practice and
doctrine.</p>

<p>It is but lately that stern necessity caused the deserts of
the Soudan to be strewn with the corpses of many thousands
of dervishes, and the pietist section of the British
press rejoiced at the great victory of Christianity over Islam,
and the fulfilment of a long-cherished <em>revenge</em> for the most
truly Christian of English soldiers! To such an extent can
inconsistency flourish among the most morally advanced of
the earth's inhabitants. And if Europeans have been
zealous in waging war to the death against the heathen in
the name of their common religion, they have been no
less ready to turn the gospel of peace into an apologia
for such an internecine slaughter as few other causes
have given rise to, until, at the present day, it is hardly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
possible to write seriously&mdash;in order that they may be taken
seriously&mdash;the words, "How these Christians love one
another!"</p>

<p>When we turn to India, to Ceylon, and more especially
to Burmah, we are brought face to face with a very different
state of things. It is true that in some parts&mdash;Thibet, for
instance&mdash;Buddhism has been debased to an even worse
state than Christianity in Europe; but, after all, that is
merely asserting that human nature is human nature. The
broader aspect of Buddhism in Asia must, to any unprejudiced
observer, appear in striking contrast to the prostitution
to which other religions in other corners of the earth have
been subjected. It seems to be one of the unalterable laws
which govern human conduct that the teaching of any great
religious reformer should, in the centuries which follow his
disappearance from the arena in which he had striven, be
brought low and narrowed down, partly by the short-sightedness
of its adherents, but mostly owing to the unhealthy
influences of ecclesiastical domination such as was typical
of mediæval Europe and Brahmanical India. That Buddhism
should in great degree have escaped such a fate must
be attributed, not only to the intrinsic value of the system
itself, but also to the character of the people among whom
it has survived.</p>

<p>There have been many calumniators, from interested
motives, of Buddhism; but no false representations, however
frequently reiterated, can serve to mask the purity and
nobility of this remarkable religion. It has never, like
Christianity, been made the pretext of warfare and the conquest
of alien races; no blood has ever been shed in its
propagation; no despairing cries of martyred wives and
orphan children rise up from the centuries that are past to
stamp its forehead with the brand of Cain. By reason
alone has it spread and become endeared to the many
millions who now owe it allegiance; reason and truth are
the only swords which have been unsheathed in the cause<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
of its promulgation.<a name="FNanchor_AT_46" id="FNanchor_AT_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_AT_46" class="fnanchor">[AT]</a> It has, in fact, conquered by its
sweet reasonableness alone, unaided by artificial and compulsory
means.</p>

<p>The gradually diminishing popularity of the religious war
sentiment which actuates people to perpetrate such iniquities
as Crusades and Jehads will, it is presumed, afford relief in
the future, at least to some sections of the Christian world,
by removing an opportunity out of the way for the reproach
of those who take their stand by the non-resistance principle
as enunciated by the founder of the Christian faith. The
carrying out of the non-resistance principle in its totality
seems to increase in impracticability in proportion to the
advancing complexity of social and national life. A very
near approach to the achievement of the object embodied
in the principle can only be imagined possible under the
most primitive conditions of existence, notably in such cases
where the country inhabited provides the necessities of life
without involving any violent struggle for their acquisition.
Christian nations, by the force of circumstances and the
nature of their environment, are unfortunately impelled,
it would seem, to disregard and set aside the very distinct
teaching of Jesus on this point; and some of us, facing both
ways, endeavour to escape from the dilemma, and pour balm
upon our consciences, by assuming that war is amply justified
by Scripture and expressly sanctioned by the Almighty. In
this connection it would perhaps be the most straightforward
course for us to frankly admit with Tolstoi that war is as
fundamentally un-Christian as it is un-Buddhistic, and to be
prepared to face the consequences of its unlawfulness in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
the sight of God rather than to dislocate the teaching of
Jesus with a view to the selfish satisfaction of our consciences,
and for the ultimate purpose of settling down into
a comfortable frame of mind when brought into contact
with this unpleasant subject.</p>

<p>In spite of the many detractors Buddhism has had, it has
been appreciated in cultivated centres of Europe and
America to an extent which is the surest token of its intrinsic
worth. In Asia it is difficult to realize how profound and
enduring has been its influence for good.</p>

<p>Perhaps, on account of the presence of dogmas, such as
the negation of soul as a permanent individual entity and
of immortality as it is known among us, which are to the
average European intellect absurd and most repugnant, it
has been more readily assimilated as a belief by races
which, unlike ourselves, are philosophic by nature and by
birth. But by far the most important part of Buddhism in
its practical significance is the doctrine of Karma, which
has proved so great a stumbling-block to many, and a
medium of contempt for those professing other faiths. It
would hardly be exaggeration to describe this as one of the
grandest ethical theories ever devised by the brain of man,
ranging as it does over the whole sphere of human activity
and existence, and policing, as it were, the actions of human
creatures.</p>

<p>Lest it should appear to any of my readers that I have
laid undue stress upon the value and beauty of Buddhism
in the foregoing pages, I would take this opportunity of disclaiming
any intention on my part to draw invidious distinctions
between the manifestations of the two faiths of
which I have treated, and which, in my opinion, are <em>fundamentally</em>
one and the same.</p>

<p>In this connection my sole aim has been to give prominence
to the many excellent properties possessed by Buddhism,
with a view to clearing the way for an impartial
appreciation of this religion by those who have never yet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
bestowed their attention or extended their sympathies to
the subject with unbiased minds.</p>

<p>The dissolution, not the destruction, of symbolism which
I have endeavoured to accomplish in dealing with the metaphysic
of Christianity and Buddhism&mdash;of that symbolism
which is so apt, when taken as a thing in itself, to contract
our sympathies and darken our vision in respect of religions&mdash;will
have achieved an object if it succeeds in carrying
with it the conviction, at present<a name="FNanchor_AU_47" id="FNanchor_AU_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_AU_47" class="fnanchor">[AU]</a> so indisturbably possessed
by the writer, that <em>essential</em> Christianity and <em>true</em> Buddhism
cannot be differentiated; that the ultimate source of their
power and loveliness is one; that they rest upon the same
imperishable foundations, which are lost to sight in billowy
clouds of mystery, in a splendour beyond imagining.</p>

<p>The priest in Zola's <cite>Rome</cite> looked forward to the day
when symbols and rites, so necessary in the infancy of the
world, would disappear altogether&mdash;"to the time when
enlarged, purified, and instructed humanity would be able
to support the brightness of naked truth" without their
assistance.</p>

<p>It may be, however, that any premature abandonment of
symbols, rites, and ceremonies might, under present conditions,
prove disastrous, as such a course would go far
to arrest artistic tendencies and stifle within us those cravings
for the beautiful which are such undeniably potent and
useful factors in conducting us onward to a realization of
the invisible. All that appears requisite in this direction at
the present moment is that the symbolic element in
symbolism should be clearly recognized, and symbolism
appraised at its true value.</p>

<p>Concurrently with the development of a deeper insight
into the realities which subsist in symbols, there should
arise in these Northern latitudes a class of people who would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
demonstrate by their character and actions that, under
existing social conditions, and in all the turmoil of modern
civilization, a nearer approach to the ideal life than has yet
been made by a community is within the range of practicalities.
This is the most clamant need of the day.</p>

<p>In our Western world we are confronted with innumerable
obstacles in the way of leading the ideal, or Christ-like, life.
The ideal <em>life-germ</em> is in all of us, but too often hidden away
under the veneer of respectability, and much obscured by
conventionalities. This germ, if not very apparent in our
public capacity, is distinctly discernible in the family life as
typical of these islands. We see it in the eyes of the wife, in the
restraint of the son, and we listen to it in the voices of our
daughters. It struggles hard to develop itself in the face of
stupendous difficulties. Its growth among our spiritual
leaders is frequently handicapped by the isolating effects of
aggrandizement. A cardinal, for instance&mdash;good and gracious
as he invariably is&mdash;must always be more or less inaccessible
and appalling. Our charities, too, are vitiated by ostentation.
Prospectuses demand that a royalty should take the
lead, and the titled figure as patrons, if the appeal made is
designed to be irresistible. So that, to whichever side we
turn, we find ourselves hampered in our aspirations towards
the ideal by the exigencies of society, by our customs and
absurdities.</p>

<p>Turning to the far East, we are face to face with other
conditions, which undoubtedly lend themselves more readily
to the impress of the ideal. Burmah is a country where
strikingly successful endeavours continue to be made to
hold constantly before the eyes of the people exemplars of
the ideal life, and the results are astonishing&mdash;approximating
a perfection which it is hardly possible to over-rate. Notwithstanding
the enormous capacity and appreciation its
inhabitants possess for the frivolities of existence, they are
wont to support out of their slender resources a numerous
staff of monks, who are to be found in all parts of the land,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
and in every place where their fellow-creatures congregate
in small or large numbers.</p>

<p>However far laymen may deviate from the <em>Path</em>, the ideal
life as exemplified by the monks must not be tampered with.
It is the expressed will of the laity that this example should
be unremittingly preserved in all its integrity and purity,
whatever may be the sum of their own failings. It is this
intense admiration and fervour on the part of the lay
community for the ideal life, as known to them through the
teaching of the Enlightened One, that has secured this
incalculable blessing to the people, and made Burmah a
model for all nations in this respect.</p>

<p>There is a sadness unspeakable in the thought that
perhaps, ere long, this ancient and ennobling bond between
the people and their religious teachers, between the material
and the ideal, will be swept away in the wake of commerce
and utilitarianism, and all their attendant debasements.</p>

<p>Mr. Fielding, in his book, <cite>The Soul of a People</cite>, brings
all his unique experiences and intimate knowledge of
the Burmese and the monkhood to impress upon us this
marvellous object-lesson in the effect of a religion whose
abiding principles are an ever-present, living force, and of
which it may be truly said it is the same yesterday, to-day,
and for ever.</p>

<p>Everywhere, intermingled with this light-hearted people,
delighting in colour, dress, and decoration of all kinds,
there is ever to be seen the serene and passionless personality
of the monk; no reviler of alien creeds; no
possessor of priestly power; poorer than the poorest, yet
rich in the inheritance of the Dharma; no figure-head of
some illustrious superstition, mitred, and heralded through
the streets; nought&mdash;save a lowly follower of the Perfect
One, whose law it is that guides to the Great Peace, which,</p>

philosophical presentment of Buddhism as first conceived. It was
more adapted to the sage than to the masses who required a symbolic
presentation, such as is afforded by the Mahayâna, or Great Vehicle of
Salvation. We see the same kind of development holding a place in
the history of Christianity. Upon the enigmatical utterances of Jesus
and the mystical sophisms of St. Paul there has been raised a splendid
fabric of dogmatic ecclesiasticism; and under the shadow of its symbolism
the poor in spirit, the ignorant and the weak, have found consolations
which would not have been theirs if no such development of
the abstract principles of the faith had taken place.</p></div>

consciousness for the transmissive process in the brain, as hypothecated
by Professor William James in his lecture on <cite>Human Immortality</cite>,
I would substitute a formative faculty immanent in the universe, and
assume the metamorphosis into consciousness, as we know it, to be a
function of the brain. This theory would be quite reconcileable with
the physiological view that consciousness is the final phase of the
activity of the sensory nerves in the cortex of that organ. Fechner's
conception of a psycho-physical threshold would also adapt itself to this
theory as well as to the other; the threshold being understood as representing
the functional capacity of the brain to extend or limit the scope
of consciousness. The ultimate extension of consciousness would result
in a return to the elemental informative. In the case of limited extension,
consciousness would be carried on as a consciousness-germ, or
Skandha, into a new being, on the death of a being.</p></div>

troubles, to give us our daily food, not to be too severe upon us, not to
punish us as we deserve; but to be merciful and kind. But the
Buddhist has far other thoughts than these. He believes that the world
is ruled by everlasting, unchangeable laws of righteousness. The
Great God lives far behind His laws, and they are for ever and ever.
You cannot change the laws of righteousness by praising them, or by
crying against them, any more than you can change the revolution of
the earth. Sin begets sorrow, sorrow is the only purifier from sin;
these are eternal sequences; they cannot be altered; it would not be
good that they should be altered. The Buddhist believes that the
sequences are founded on righteousness, are the path to righteousness;
and he does not believe he could alter them for the better, even if he
had the power by prayer to do so.... This has been called a pessimism.
Surely it is the greatest optimism the world has known&mdash;this certainty
that the world is ruled by righteousness; that the world has been, that
the world will always be, ruled by perfect righteousness.... The God
who lies far beyond our ken has delegated his authority to no one. He
works through everlasting laws. His will is manifested by unchangeable
sequences. There is nothing hidden about His law that requires
exposition by his agents, nor any ceremonies necessary for acceptance
into his faith. Buddhism is a free religion. No one holds the keys of
salvation but himself. Buddhism never dreams that anyone can save
or damn you except yourself, and so a Buddhist monk is so far away
from our ideas of a priest as can be. Nothing could be more abhorrent
to Buddhism than any claim of authority of power from above, of
holiness acquired, except by the earnest effort of a man's own soul"
